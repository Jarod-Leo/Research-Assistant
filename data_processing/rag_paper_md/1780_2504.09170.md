# Langformers: Unified NLP Pipelines for Language Models

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09170v1

原文摘要:
Transformer-based language models have revolutionized the field of natural
language processing (NLP). However, using these models often involves
navigating multiple frameworks and tools, as well as writing repetitive
boilerplate code. This complexity can discourage non-programmers and beginners,
and even slow down prototyping for experienced developers. To address these
challenges, we introduce Langformers, an open-source Python library designed to
streamline NLP pipelines through a unified, factory-based interface for large
language model (LLM) and masked language model (MLM) tasks. Langformers
integrates conversational AI, MLM pretraining, text classification, sentence
embedding/reranking, data labelling, semantic search, and knowledge
distillation into a cohesive API, supporting popular platforms such as Hugging
Face and Ollama. Key innovations include: (1) task-specific factories that
abstract training, inference, and deployment complexities; (2) built-in memory
and streaming for conversational agents; and (3) lightweight, modular design
that prioritizes ease of use. Documentation: https://langformers.com

基于Transformer的语言模型彻底改变了自然语言处理（NLP）领域。然而，使用这些模型通常需要操作多个框架和工具，并编写大量重复的样板代码。这种复杂性可能会阻碍非程序员和初学者，甚至拖慢资深开发者的原型设计速度。为解决这些挑战，我们推出了Langformers——一个开源的Python库，旨在通过为大型语言模型（LLM）和掩码语言模型（MLM）任务提供统一的工厂式接口来简化NLP流程。该库将对话式AI、MLM预训练、文本分类、句子嵌入/重排序、数据标注、语义搜索以及知识蒸馏等功能整合为连贯的API，支持Hugging Face和Ollama等主流平台。其核心创新包括：（1）通过任务专属工厂抽象化训练、推理与部署的复杂性；（2）为对话代理内置记忆与流式处理功能；（3）采用轻量级模块化设计，优先保障易用性。文档详见：https://langformers.com
