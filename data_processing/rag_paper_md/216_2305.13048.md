# RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era

原文摘要:
Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP)
tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales
quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but
struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in
parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture,
Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient
parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs.
  Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to
formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing
computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory
complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion
parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs
on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage
this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a
significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational
efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.

Transformer模型已彻底革新了几乎所有自然语言处理（NLP）任务，但其内存和计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次方增长。相比之下，循环神经网络（RNN）在内存和计算需求上呈现线性增长，却因并行化与可扩展性的局限难以达到与Transformer同等的性能。我们提出了一种新颖的模型架构——接收加权键值（RWKV），它融合了Transformer高效并行化训练与RNN高效推理的优势。

该架构采用线性注意力机制，使模型既能以Transformer形式构建，又能转化为RNN形态，从而在训练阶段实现并行计算，在推理阶段保持恒定的计算和内存复杂度。我们将模型参数量扩展至140亿规模（迄今最大规模的稠密RNN），发现RWKV性能与同体量Transformer相当，这表明未来研究可基于此架构开发更高效的模型。这项工作为序列处理任务中计算效率与模型性能的权衡提供了重要突破。
