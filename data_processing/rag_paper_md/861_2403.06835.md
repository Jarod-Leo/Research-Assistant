原文摘要:
Data scarcity and privacy concerns limit the availability of high-quality
medical images for public use, which can be mitigated through medical image
synthesis. However, current medical image synthesis methods often struggle to
accurately capture the complexity of detailed anatomical structures and
pathological conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
medical image synthesis model that leverages fine-grained image-text alignment
and anatomy-pathology prompts to generate highly detailed and accurate
synthetic medical images. Our method integrates advanced natural language
processing techniques with image generative modeling, enabling precise
alignment between descriptive text prompts and the synthesized images'
anatomical and pathological details. The proposed approach consists of two key
components: an anatomy-pathology prompting module and a fine-grained
alignment-based synthesis module. The anatomy-pathology prompting module
automatically generates descriptive prompts for high-quality medical images. To
further synthesize high-quality medical images from the generated prompts, the
fine-grained alignment-based synthesis module pre-defines a visual codebook for
the radiology dataset and performs fine-grained alignment between the codebook
and generated prompts to obtain key patches as visual clues, facilitating
accurate image synthesis. We validate the superiority of our method through
experiments on public chest X-ray datasets and demonstrate that our synthetic
images preserve accurate semantic information, making them valuable for various
medical applications.

数据稀缺与隐私问题限制了高质量医学图像的公开获取，而医学图像合成技术可有效缓解这一困境。然而现有合成方法往往难以精确捕捉复杂解剖结构与病理特征的细节。为此，我们提出了一种新型医学图像合成模型，通过细粒度图文对齐和解剖-病理提示机制生成高度精细准确的合成医学图像。该方法将先进自然语言处理技术与图像生成建模相结合，实现了描述性文本提示与合成图像解剖病理细节的精准匹配。

本框架包含两大核心组件：解剖-病理提示模块和基于细粒度对齐的合成模块。解剖-病理提示模块能自动为高质量医学图像生成描述性提示文本。为将这些文本转化为优质医学图像，基于细粒度对齐的合成模块预先构建放射学数据集的视觉码本，通过码本与生成提示间的细粒度对齐获取关键图像块作为视觉线索，从而确保合成准确性。在公开胸部X光数据集上的实验验证表明，本方法生成的图像能完整保留语义信息，为多种医疗应用提供了宝贵资源。
