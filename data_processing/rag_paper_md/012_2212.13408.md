# NEEDED: Introducing Hierarchical Transformer to Eye Diseases Diagnosis

原文摘要:
With the development of natural language processing techniques(NLP),
automatic diagnosis of eye diseases using ophthalmology electronic medical
records (OEMR) has become possible. It aims to evaluate the condition of both
eyes of a patient respectively, and we formulate it as a particular multi-label
classification task in this paper. Although there are a few related studies in
other diseases, automatic diagnosis of eye diseases exhibits unique
characteristics. First, descriptions of both eyes are mixed up in OEMR
documents, with both free text and templated asymptomatic descriptions,
resulting in sparsity and clutter of information. Second, OEMR documents
contain multiple parts of descriptions and have long document lengths. Third,
it is critical to provide explainability to the disease diagnosis model. To
overcome those challenges, we present an effective automatic eye disease
diagnosis framework, NEEDED. In this framework, a preprocessing module is
integrated to improve the density and quality of information. Then, we design a
hierarchical transformer structure for learning the contextualized
representations of each sentence in the OEMR document. For the diagnosis part,
we propose an attention-based predictor that enables traceable diagnosis by
obtaining disease-specific information. Experiments on the real dataset and
comparison with several baseline models show the advantage and explainability
of our framework.

随着自然语言处理技术(NLP)的发展，利用眼科电子病历(OEMR)实现眼疾自动诊断已成为可能。该任务需分别评估患者双眼状况，本文将其定义为一种特殊的多标签分类问题。尽管其他疾病领域已有相关研究，但眼疾自动诊断具有独特特征：首先，OEMR文档中双眼描述相互混杂，既包含自由文本又含模板化无症状描述，导致信息稀疏且杂乱；其次，OEMR文档包含多部分描述且篇幅较长；第三，疾病诊断模型的可解释性至关重要。针对这些挑战，我们提出了有效的眼疾自动诊断框架NEEDED。该框架集成预处理模块提升信息密度与质量，设计分层Transformer结构学习OEMR文档中各句子的上下文表征，并创新性地采用基于注意力的预测器，通过获取疾病特异性信息实现可追溯诊断。在真实数据集上的实验及与多种基线模型的对比验证了本框架的优势与可解释性。
