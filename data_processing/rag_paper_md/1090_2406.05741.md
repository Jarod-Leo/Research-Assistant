原文摘要:
Digital transformation (DX) has recently become a pressing issue for many
companies as the latest digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence
and the Internet of Things, can be easily utilized. However, devising new
business models is not easy for compa-nies, though they can improve their
operations through digital technologies. Thus, business model design support
methods are needed by people who lack digital tech-nology expertise. In
contrast, large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT and natural
language processing utilizing LLMs have been developed revolutionarily. A
business model design support system that utilizes these technologies has great
potential. However, research on this area is scant. Accordingly, this study
proposes an LLM-based method for comparing and analyzing similar companies from
different business do-mains as a first step toward business model design
support utilizing LLMs. This method can support idea generation in digital
business model design.

数字化转型(DX)正成为众多企业的紧迫议题，随着人工智能和物联网等前沿数字技术的普及应用，企业虽能借助这些技术优化运营，但创新商业模式仍面临挑战。因此，缺乏数字技术专长的人员亟需商业模式设计支持方法。与此同时，以ChatGPT为代表的大语言模型(LLM)及基于LLM的自然语言处理技术正经历革命性发展，利用这些技术构建商业模式设计支持系统具有巨大潜力。然而该领域研究尚属空白。为此，本研究提出一种基于LLM的跨行业相似企业对比分析方法，作为利用大语言模型支持商业模式设计的初步探索。该方法可为数字化商业模式设计中的创意生成提供支持。
