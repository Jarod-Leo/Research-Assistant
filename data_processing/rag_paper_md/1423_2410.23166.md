原文摘要:
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new
possibilities for automating the proposal of innovative scientific ideas. This
process involves two key phases: literature retrieval and idea generation.
However, existing approaches often fall short due to their reliance on
keyword-based search tools during the retrieval phase, which neglects crucial
semantic information and frequently results in incomplete retrieval outcomes.
Similarly, in the idea generation phase, current methodologies tend to depend
solely on the internal knowledge of LLMs or metadata from retrieved papers,
thereby overlooking significant valuable insights contained within the full
texts. To address these limitations, we introduce SciPIP, an innovative
framework designed to enhance the LLM-based proposal of scientific ideas
through improvements in both literature retrieval and idea generation. Our
approach begins with the construction of a comprehensive literature database
that supports advanced retrieval based not only on keywords but also on
semantics and citation relationships. This is complemented by the introduction
of a multi-granularity retrieval algorithm aimed at ensuring more thorough and
exhaustive retrieval results. For the idea generation phase, we propose a
dual-path framework that effectively integrates both the content of retrieved
papers and the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs. This integration
significantly boosts the novelty, feasibility, and practical value of proposed
ideas. Our experiments, conducted across various domains such as natural
language processing and computer vision, demonstrate SciPIP's capability to
generate a multitude of innovative and useful ideas. These findings underscore
SciPIP's potential as a valuable tool for researchers seeking to advance their
fields with groundbreaking concepts.

大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展为自动化生成创新科学构想开辟了新途径。这一过程涉及两个关键阶段：文献检索与创意生成。然而现有方法存在明显局限——检索阶段过度依赖基于关键词的搜索工具，忽视语义信息导致检索结果不完整；生成阶段仅利用LLM内部知识或论文元数据，未能充分挖掘全文价值。为此，我们提出SciPIP创新框架，通过双重优化提升基于LLM的科学构想生成能力。该框架首先构建支持关键词、语义与引文关系多维检索的综合文献数据库，并设计多粒度检索算法确保结果全面性；在生成阶段首创双路径架构，有机融合检索文献内容与LLM内部知识，显著提升构想的新颖性、可行性与实用价值。跨自然语言处理、计算机视觉等领域的实验表明，SciPIP能系统产生大量创新且实用的研究构想，其突破性表现为研究者推动学科发展提供了有力工具。
