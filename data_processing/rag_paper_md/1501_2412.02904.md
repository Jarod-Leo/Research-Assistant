原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural
language processing with their impressive reasoning and question-answering
capabilities. However, these models are sometimes prone to generating
credible-sounding but incorrect information, a phenomenon known as LLM
hallucinations. Reliable uncertainty estimation in LLMs is essential for
fostering trust in their generated responses and serves as a critical tool for
the detection and prevention of erroneous or hallucinated outputs. To achieve
reliable and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification in open-ended and
free-form natural language generation, we propose an uncertainty-aware
fine-tuning approach for LLMs. This approach enhances the model's ability to
provide reliable uncertainty estimates without compromising accuracy, thereby
guiding them to produce more trustworthy responses. We introduce a novel
uncertainty-aware causal language modeling loss function, grounded in the
principles of decision theory. Through rigorous evaluation on multiple
free-form question-answering datasets and models, we demonstrate that our
uncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach yields better calibrated uncertainty
estimates in natural language generation tasks than fine-tuning with the
standard causal language modeling loss. Furthermore, the experimental results
show that the proposed method significantly improves the model's ability to
detect hallucinations and identify out-of-domain prompts.

大语言模型（LLMs）凭借其卓越的推理与问答能力，彻底革新了自然语言处理领域。然而，这些模型有时会生成看似可信实则错误的信息，这种现象被称为LLM幻觉。实现可靠的不确定性估计对于增强用户对生成内容的信任至关重要，同时也是检测和预防错误或幻觉输出的关键工具。为在开放域自由形式的自然语言生成中实现可靠且校准良好的不确定性量化，我们提出了一种面向LLMs的不确定性感知微调方法。该方法在不损害准确性的前提下，显著提升了模型提供可靠不确定性评估的能力，从而引导其生成更具可信度的响应。基于决策理论原理，我们创新性地设计了一种不确定性感知因果语言建模损失函数。通过在多个自由形式问答数据集和模型上的严格评估，我们证明相较于标准因果语言建模损失的微调方法，我们的不确定性感知微调方案能在自然语言生成任务中产生更优校准的不确定性估计。实验结果表明，所提方法显著增强了模型检测幻觉和识别域外提示的能力。
