原文摘要:
Generative AI has demonstrated unprecedented creativity in the field of
computer vision, yet such phenomena have not been observed in natural language
processing. In particular, large language models (LLMs) can hardly produce
written works at the level of human experts due to the extremely high
complexity of literature writing. In this paper, we present HoLLMwood, an
automated framework for unleashing the creativity of LLMs and exploring their
potential in screenwriting, which is a highly demanding task. Mimicking the
human creative process, we assign LLMs to different roles involved in the
real-world scenario. In addition to the common practice of treating LLMs as
${Writer}$, we also apply LLMs as ${Editor}$, who is responsible for providing
feedback and revision advice to ${Writer}$. Besides, to enrich the characters
and deepen the plots, we introduce a role-playing mechanism and adopt LLMs as
${Actors}$ that can communicate and interact with each other. Evaluations on
automatically generated screenplays show that HoLLMwood substantially
outperforms strong baselines in terms of coherence, relevance, interestingness
and overall quality.

生成式人工智能在计算机视觉领域展现出前所未有的创造力，然而这一现象尚未在自然语言处理领域得到验证。特别是由于文学创作的极高复杂性，大型语言模型（LLMs）难以产出达到人类专家水平的书面作品。本文提出HoLLMwood框架——一个通过模拟人类创作流程来释放LLMs创造力并探索其剧本写作潜能的自动化系统。我们参照现实创作场景，为LLMs分配不同职能角色：除常规将LLMs作为${作家}$外，还将其作为${编辑}$负责提供反馈与修改建议；同时引入角色扮演机制，采用LLMs担任可相互对话的${演员}$角色，以此丰富人物塑造并深化情节发展。对自动生成剧本的评估表明，HoLLMwood在连贯性、相关性、趣味性和整体质量上显著优于基线模型。
