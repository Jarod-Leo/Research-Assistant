原文摘要:
Audio descriptions (ADs) function as acoustic commentaries designed to assist
blind persons and persons with visual impairments in accessing digital media
content on television and in movies, among other settings. As an accessibility
service typically provided by trained AD professionals, the generation of ADs
demands significant human effort, making the process both time-consuming and
costly. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and computer
vision (CV), particularly in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have allowed for getting a step closer to automatic AD
generation. This paper reviews the technologies pertinent to AD generation in
the era of LLMs and VLMs: we discuss how state-of-the-art NLP and CV
technologies can be applied to generate ADs and identify essential research
directions for the future.
