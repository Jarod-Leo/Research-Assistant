原文摘要:
The misuse of real photographs with conflicting image captions in news items
is an example of the out-of-context (OOC) misuse of media. In order to detect
OOC media, individuals must determine the accuracy of the statement and
evaluate whether the triplet (~\textit{i.e.}, the image and two captions)
relates to the same event. This paper presents a novel learnable approach for
detecting OOC media in ICME'23 Grand Challenge on Detecting Cheapfakes. The
proposed method is based on the COSMOS structure, which assesses the coherence
between an image and captions, as well as between two captions. We enhance the
baseline algorithm by incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM), GPT3.5, as a
feature extractor. Specifically, we propose an innovative approach to feature
extraction utilizing prompt engineering to develop a robust and reliable
feature extractor with GPT3.5 model. The proposed method captures the
correlation between two captions and effectively integrates this module into
the COSMOS baseline model, which allows for a deeper understanding of the
relationship between captions. By incorporating this module, we demonstrate the
potential for significant improvements in cheap-fakes detection performance.
The proposed methodology holds promising implications for various applications
such as natural language processing, image captioning, and text-to-image
synthesis. Docker for submission is available at

新闻中真实照片与矛盾文字说明的误用，是媒体脱离上下文（OOC）滥用现象的典型案例。要检测OOC媒体，需判断陈述准确性并评估三元组（即图像与两个说明文字）是否指向同一事件。本文针对ICME'23"检测廉价伪造"大挑战，提出了一种新颖的可学习OOC媒体检测方法。该方法基于COSMOS架构，评估图像与说明文字之间以及两个说明文字之间的连贯性。我们通过引入大型语言模型（LLM）GPT3.5作为特征提取器来增强基线算法，具体提出了一种利用提示工程的创新特征提取方法，构建基于GPT3.5模型的鲁棒可靠特征提取器。该方法捕捉两个说明文字之间的相关性，并将该模块有效整合至COSMOS基线模型，从而深化对说明文字关系的理解。实验证明该模块能显著提升廉价伪造检测性能，该方法对自然语言处理、图像描述生成和文本到图像合成等应用具有重要启示。提交用Docker镜像详见https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mulns/acmmmcheapfakes。
