原文摘要:
In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made
significant breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing and has
gradually been applied to the field of humanities and social sciences research.
LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and
social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and
reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can
analyze large-scale text data and make inferences.
  This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven
aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering,
student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational
measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education
. Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with
the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities
and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can
give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview,
it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed
explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a
detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for
quick reading.
  Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the
field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in
improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields.
LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to
deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences,
and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.

近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展在自然语言处理领域取得重大突破，并逐步应用于人文社科研究领域。凭借强大的文本理解、生成与推理能力，LLMs在人文社科领域具有广泛的应用价值——能够对海量文本数据进行分析推演。

本文从低资源语言翻译、教育问答、高等教育学生写作提升、逻辑推理、教育测量与心理计量、公共卫生政策分析、艺术教育七个维度对深度求索大模型DeepSeek-R1进行测评，并将其在七个维度的作答表现与o1-preview模型进行对比。研究发现：DeepSeek-R1在人文社科领域表现优异，能正确且符合逻辑地回答大部分问题，并能给出合理的分析过程与解释说明；相较于o1-preview，该模型能自动生成推理过程并提供更详尽的解释说明，适合初学者或需要深入了解相关知识的人群，而o1-preview更适用于快速阅读场景。

分析表明，LLM在人文社科领域具有广阔的应用潜力，在提升文本分析效率、语言交流等领域展现出巨大优势。其强大的语言理解与生成能力，使其能够深入探究人文社科领域的复杂问题，为学术研究和实践应用提供创新性工具。
