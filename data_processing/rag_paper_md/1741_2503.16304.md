原文摘要:
In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made
significant breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing and has
gradually been applied to the field of humanities and social sciences research.
LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and
social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and
reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can
analyze large-scale text data and make inferences.
  This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven
aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering,
student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational
measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education
. Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with
the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities
and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can
give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview,
it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed
explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a
detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for
quick reading.
  Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the
field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in
improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields.
LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to
deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences,
and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.

近年来，大语言模型（LLM）的发展在自然语言处理领域取得重大突破，并逐渐应用于人文社科研究领域。大语言模型因其强大的文本理解、生成与推理能力，在人文社科领域具有广泛的应用价值。在人文社科研究中，大语言模型可以分析大规模文本数据并进行推理。

本文从低资源语言翻译、教育问答、高等教育学生写作提升、逻辑推理、教育测量与心理计量学、公共卫生政策分析、艺术教育七个方面对大语言模型DeepSeek-R1进行分析。然后将DeepSeek-R1在七个方面给出的答案与o1-preview给出的答案进行对比。DeepSeek-R1在人文社科方面表现良好，能够正确且富有逻辑地回答大部分问题，并能给出合理的分析过程和解释。与o1-preview相比，其能够自动生成推理过程，并提供更详细的解释，适合初学者或需要对此知识有详细了解的人，而o1-preview更适合快速阅读。

通过分析发现，大语言模型在人文社科领域具有广阔的应用潜力，在提升文本分析效率、语言交流等领域展现出巨大优势。大语言模型强大的语言理解和生成能力使其能够深入探究人文社科领域的复杂问题，为学术研究和实际应用提供创新性工具。
