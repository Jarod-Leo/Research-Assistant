原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly transformed our daily life
and established a new paradigm in natural language processing (NLP). However,
the predominant pretraining of LLMs on extensive web-based texts remains
insufficient for advanced scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry. The
scarcity of specialized chemistry data, coupled with the complexity of
multi-modal data such as 2D graph, 3D structure and spectrum, present distinct
challenges. Although several studies have reviewed Pretrained Language Models
(PLMs) in chemistry, there is a conspicuous absence of a systematic survey
specifically focused on chemistry-oriented LLMs. In this paper, we outline
methodologies for incorporating domain-specific chemistry knowledge and
multi-modal information into LLMs, we also conceptualize chemistry LLMs as
agents using chemistry tools and investigate their potential to accelerate
scientific research. Additionally, we conclude the existing benchmarks to
evaluate chemistry ability of LLMs. Finally, we critically examine the current
challenges and identify promising directions for future research. Through this
comprehensive survey, we aim to assist researchers in staying at the forefront
of developments in chemistry LLMs and to inspire innovative applications in the
field.

大型语言模型（LLMs）已深刻重塑日常生活，并开创了自然语言处理（NLP）的新范式。然而，当前主流基于海量网络文本的预训练模式仍难以支撑前沿科学发现，尤其在化学领域。专业化学数据的稀缺性，叠加二维分子图、三维结构与光谱等多模态数据的复杂性，构成了独特挑战。尽管已有若干研究综述化学领域的预训练语言模型（PLMs），但针对化学专用LLMs的系统性梳理仍属空白。本文系统阐述了领域化学知识与多模态信息融合至LLMs的方法论框架，创新性提出将化学LLMs概念化为工具调用智能体以推动科研加速，并归纳了现有化学能力评估基准。最后，我们批判性分析当前瓶颈问题，指明未来研究的突破方向。通过这项全景式综述，旨在助力研究者把握化学LLMs发展前沿，激发该领域的创新应用探索。
