链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06426v1

原文摘要:
Linguistic ambiguity is and has always been one of the main challenges in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Modern Transformer architectures
like BERT, T5 or more recently InstructGPT have achieved some impressive
improvements in many NLP fields, but there is still plenty of work to do.
Motivated by the uproar caused by ChatGPT, in this paper we provide an
introduction to linguistic ambiguity, its varieties and their relevance in
modern NLP, and perform an extensive empiric analysis. ChatGPT strengths and
weaknesses are revealed, as well as strategies to get the most of this model.
