原文摘要:
Software defined networking (SDN) represents a transformative shift in
network architecture by decoupling the control plane from the data plane,
enabling centralized and flexible management of network resources. However,
this architectural shift introduces significant security challenges, as SDN's
centralized control becomes an attractive target for various types of attacks.
While current research has yielded valuable insights into attack detection in
SDN, critical gaps remain. Addressing challenges in feature selection,
broadening the scope beyond DDoS attacks, strengthening attack decisions based
on multi flow analysis, and building models capable of detecting unseen attacks
that they have not been explicitly trained on are essential steps toward
advancing security in SDN. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that
leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the pre trained BERT base model
to enhance attack detection in SDN. Our approach transforms network flow data
into a format interpretable by language models, allowing BERT to capture
intricate patterns and relationships within network traffic. By using Random
Forest for feature selection, we optimize model performance and reduce
computational overhead, ensuring accurate detection. Attack decisions are made
based on several flows, providing stronger and more reliable detection of
malicious traffic. Furthermore, our approach is specifically designed to detect
previously unseen attacks, offering a solution for identifying threats that the
model was not explicitly trained on. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we
conducted experiments in two scenarios: one focused on detecting known attacks,
achieving 99.96% accuracy, and another on detecting unseen attacks, where our
model achieved 99.96% accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of our approach in
detecting evolving threats to improve the security of SDN networks.

软件定义网络（SDN）通过解耦控制平面与数据平面，实现了网络资源的集中化灵活管理，标志着网络架构的根本性变革。然而这种架构转变也带来了严峻的安全挑战——集中化的控制层成为各类攻击的诱人目标。尽管现有研究在SDN攻击检测方面取得了重要进展，但仍存在关键性缺陷：需解决特征选择难题、突破DDoS攻击的单一研究范畴、强化基于多流分析的攻击决策机制，以及构建能够检测训练数据之外新型攻击的模型。本文创新性地提出结合自然语言处理（NLP）与预训练BERT基础模型的方法来增强SDN攻击检测能力。该方法将网络流数据转化为语言模型可解析的格式，使BERT能够捕捉流量中的复杂模式与关联关系。通过随机森林算法进行特征选择，我们在确保检测准确性的同时优化了模型性能并降低计算开销。基于多流联合分析的攻击决策机制显著提升了恶意流量检测的可靠性与鲁棒性。特别值得注意的是，该方法专门针对训练数据中未出现过的新型攻击进行检测，为未知威胁识别提供了解决方案。我们在两种实验场景下进行了严格验证：已知攻击检测场景达到99.96%准确率，未知攻击检测场景同样取得99.96%的优异表现，充分证明了该方法在应对持续演变的网络威胁方面的强大能力，为提升SDN网络安全提供了有效途径。
