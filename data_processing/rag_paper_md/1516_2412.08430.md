原文摘要:
This paper provides an in-depth evaluation of three state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) for personalized career mentoring in the computing
field, using three distinct student profiles that consider gender, race, and
professional levels. We evaluated the performance of GPT-4, LLaMA 3, and Palm 2
using a zero-shot learning approach without human intervention. A quantitative
evaluation was conducted through a custom natural language processing analytics
pipeline to highlight the uniqueness of the responses and to identify words
reflecting each student's profile, including race, gender, or professional
level. The analysis of frequently used words in the responses indicates that
GPT-4 offers more personalized mentoring compared to the other two LLMs.
Additionally, a qualitative evaluation was performed to see if human experts
reached similar conclusions. The analysis of survey responses shows that GPT-4
outperformed the other two LLMs in delivering more accurate and useful
mentoring while addressing specific challenges with encouragement languages.
Our work establishes a foundation for developing personalized mentoring tools
based on LLMs, incorporating human mentors in the process to deliver a more
impactful and tailored mentoring experience.

本文针对计算领域个性化职业指导需求，对三种前沿大语言模型（LLMs）进行了深度评估。研究采用包含性别、种族和职业层级三个维度的差异化学生画像，通过零样本学习方法在无人干预条件下测试了GPT-4、LLaMA 3和Palm 2的表现。我们构建了定制化自然语言处理分析管道进行量化评估，重点考察回答的独特性及反映学生种族、性别或职业层级特征的关键词。高频词分析表明，相较于其他两种模型，GPT-4能提供更具个性化的指导。研究同时开展质性评估以验证人类专家是否达成相似结论。调查反馈分析显示，在提供准确有效指导的同时，GPT-4更擅长运用激励性语言应对具体挑战，表现优于另外两种模型。本工作为开发基于LLMs的个性化指导工具奠定了基础，通过整合人类导师的参与，可提供更具影响力和针对性的指导体验。
