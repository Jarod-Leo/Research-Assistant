# SAM.MD: Zero-shot medical image segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model

原文摘要:
Foundation models have taken over natural language processing and image
generation domains due to the flexibility of prompting. With the recent
introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), this prompt-driven paradigm
has entered image segmentation with a hitherto unexplored abundance of
capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to conduct an initial evaluation of
the out-of-the-box zero-shot capabilities of SAM for medical image
segmentation, by evaluating its performance on an abdominal CT organ
segmentation task, via point or bounding box based prompting. We show that SAM
generalizes well to CT data, making it a potential catalyst for the advancement
of semi-automatic segmentation tools for clinicians. We believe that this
foundation model, while not reaching state-of-the-art segmentation performance
in our investigations, can serve as a highly potent starting point for further
adaptations of such models to the intricacies of the medical domain. Keywords:
medical image segmentation, SAM, foundation models, zero-shot learning

由于提示机制的灵活性，基础模型已主导自然语言处理和图像生成领域。随着最近Segment Anything Model（SAM）的推出，这种基于提示的范式以迄今未见的丰富能力进入了图像分割领域。本文旨在通过基于点或边界框提示的方式评估SAM在腹部CT器官分割任务中的表现，对其医学图像分割的开箱即用零样本能力进行初步评估。研究表明，SAM能良好适配CT数据，有望成为临床医生半自动分割工具发展的催化剂。我们认为，尽管该基础模型在当前研究中尚未达到最先进的分割性能，但可作为进一步适配医学领域复杂特性的强效起点。关键词：医学图像分割，SAM，基础模型，零样本学习
