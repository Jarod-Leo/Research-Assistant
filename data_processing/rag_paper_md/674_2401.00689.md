原文摘要:
The revolution of natural language processing via large language models has
motivated its use in multidisciplinary areas that include social sciences and
humanities and more specifically, comparative religion. Sentiment analysis
provides a mechanism to study the emotions expressed in text. Recently,
sentiment analysis has been used to study and compare translations of the
Bhagavad Gita, which is a fundamental and sacred Hindu text. In this study, we
use sentiment analysis for studying selected chapters of the Bible. These
chapters are known as the Sermon on the Mount. We utilize a pre-trained
language model for sentiment analysis by reviewing five translations of the
Sermon on the Mount, which include the King James version, the New
International Version, the New Revised Standard Version, the Lamsa Version, and
the Basic English Version. We provide a chapter-by-chapter and verse-by-verse
comparison using sentiment and semantic analysis and review the major
sentiments expressed. Our results highlight the varying sentiments across the
chapters and verses. We found that the vocabulary of the respective
translations is significantly different. We detected different levels of
humour, optimism, and empathy in the respective chapters that were used by
Jesus to deliver his message.

大型语言模型引发的自然语言处理革命，正推动其在包括社会科学、人文学科尤其是比较宗教学等跨学科领域的应用。情感分析为研究文本所表达的情绪提供了技术手段。近期，该技术已被用于研究印度教根本圣典《薄伽梵歌》不同译本间的差异。本研究采用情感分析方法，针对基督教《圣经》中被称为"登山宝训"的精选章节展开研究。我们运用预训练语言模型，分析了五种英文译本（詹姆士王译本、新国际版、新修订标准版、拉姆萨译本和基础英语译本）的情感特征，通过逐章逐节的情感与语义对比，系统梳理了文本传递的核心情感倾向。研究结果显示：不同章节与经节间存在显著情感差异；各译本用词具有明显区分度；在耶稣传达核心教义的不同章节中，我们检测到层次分明的幽默感、乐观精神和同理心表达。
