原文摘要:
The startling success of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) using
transformer-based generative neural network architecture in applications such
as natural language processing and image synthesis has many researchers excited
about potential opportunities in process systems engineering (PSE). The almost
human-like performance of LLMs in these areas is indeed very impressive,
surprising, and a major breakthrough. Their capabilities are very useful in
certain tasks, such as writing first drafts of documents, code writing
assistance, text summarization, etc. However, their success is limited in
highly scientific domains as they cannot yet reason, plan, or explain due to
their lack of in-depth domain knowledge. This is a problem in domains such as
chemical engineering as they are governed by fundamental laws of physics and
chemistry (and biology), constitutive relations, and highly technical knowledge
about materials, processes, and systems. Although purely data-driven machine
learning has its immediate uses, the long-term success of AI in scientific and
engineering domains would depend on developing hybrid AI systems that use first
principles and technical knowledge effectively. We call these hybrid AI systems
Large Knowledge Models (LKMs), as they will not be limited to only NLP-based
techniques or NLP-like applications. In this paper, we discuss the challenges
and opportunities in developing such systems in chemical engineering.

ChatGPT及其他基于Transformer架构生成式神经网络的大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理、图像合成等领域的惊人成功，令过程系统工程（PSE）领域众多研究者对潜在机遇充满期待。这些模型展现出的类人能力确实令人震撼，堪称重大突破——它们在文档初稿撰写、代码辅助生成、文本摘要等任务中表现卓越。然而，在高度专业化的科学领域，由于缺乏深层次领域知识而无法进行逻辑推理、任务规划或原理阐释，其应用存在明显局限。这对于化学工程等受物理化学（及生物）基本定律、本构关系和复杂专业技术知识支配的学科尤为突出。尽管纯数据驱动的机器学习具有即时应用价值，但人工智能在科技工程领域的长期成功，必然依赖于构建能有效融合第一性原理与专业知识的混合智能系统。我们将其称为"大知识模型"（LKM），因其应用范畴将突破自然语言处理技术或类NLP任务的边界。本文重点探讨化学工程领域开发此类系统面临的挑战与机遇。
