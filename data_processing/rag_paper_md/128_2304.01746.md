# Is ChatGPT a Highly Fluent Grammatical Error Correction System? A Comprehensive Evaluation

原文摘要:
ChatGPT, a large-scale language model based on the advanced GPT-3.5
architecture, has shown remarkable potential in various Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. However, there is currently a dearth of comprehensive
study exploring its potential in the area of Grammatical Error Correction
(GEC). To showcase its capabilities in GEC, we design zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot CoT settings using in-context learning for
ChatGPT. Our evaluation involves assessing ChatGPT's performance on five
official test sets in three different languages, along with three
document-level GEC test sets in English. Our experimental results and human
evaluations demonstrate that ChatGPT has excellent error detection capabilities
and can freely correct errors to make the corrected sentences very fluent,
possibly due to its over-correction tendencies and not adhering to the
principle of minimal edits. Additionally, its performance in non-English and
low-resource settings highlights its potential in multilingual GEC tasks.
However, further analysis of various types of errors at the document-level has
shown that ChatGPT cannot effectively correct agreement, coreference, tense
errors across sentences, and cross-sentence boundary errors.

ChatGPT作为基于先进GPT-3.5架构的大规模语言模型，在各类自然语言处理任务中展现出卓越潜力。然而目前缺乏对其在语法错误修正领域应用潜力的系统研究。为评估ChatGPT的GEC能力，我们设计了基于上下文学习的零样本思维链与少样本思维链实验方案。通过在五种不同语言的官方测试集及三个英语文档级GEC测试集上的评估，实验结果表明：ChatGPT具备出色的错误检测能力，其修正后的语句流畅度极高，这或许源于其过度修正倾向及未遵循最小编辑原则；在非英语及低资源场景下的表现凸显了其多语言GEC任务的潜力。但进一步分析显示，该模型对文档层面的跨句一致性、指代、时态错误及跨句边界错误等类型仍无法有效修正。
