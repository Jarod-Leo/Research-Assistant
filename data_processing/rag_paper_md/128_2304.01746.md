# Is ChatGPT a Highly Fluent Grammatical Error Correction System? A Comprehensive Evaluation

原文摘要:
ChatGPT, a large-scale language model based on the advanced GPT-3.5
architecture, has shown remarkable potential in various Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. However, there is currently a dearth of comprehensive
study exploring its potential in the area of Grammatical Error Correction
(GEC). To showcase its capabilities in GEC, we design zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot CoT settings using in-context learning for
ChatGPT. Our evaluation involves assessing ChatGPT's performance on five
official test sets in three different languages, along with three
document-level GEC test sets in English. Our experimental results and human
evaluations demonstrate that ChatGPT has excellent error detection capabilities
and can freely correct errors to make the corrected sentences very fluent,
possibly due to its over-correction tendencies and not adhering to the
principle of minimal edits. Additionally, its performance in non-English and
low-resource settings highlights its potential in multilingual GEC tasks.
However, further analysis of various types of errors at the document-level has
shown that ChatGPT cannot effectively correct agreement, coreference, tense
errors across sentences, and cross-sentence boundary errors.

基于先进GPT-3.5架构的大规模语言模型ChatGPT，已在多种自然语言处理（NLP）任务中展现出卓越潜力。然而目前尚缺乏对其在语法错误修正（GEC）领域应用潜力的系统性研究。为评估ChatGPT在GEC任务中的表现，我们采用上下文学习策略设计了零样本思维链（CoT）和少样本CoT实验方案。通过在三门语言的五个官方测试集及三个英语文档级GEC测试集上的评估，实验数据与人工校验结果表明：ChatGPT具备优异的错误检测能力，且能流畅自如地完成错误修正，这种特性可能源于其过度修正倾向及未遵循最小编辑原则。该模型在非英语及低资源场景下的表现，凸显了其在多语言GEC任务中的应用潜力。但进一步针对文档层面各类错误的分析显示，ChatGPT难以有效处理跨句一致性、指代关系、时态错误以及跨句边界错误等复杂问题。
