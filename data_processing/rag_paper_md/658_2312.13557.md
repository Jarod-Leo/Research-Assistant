原文摘要:
Recommender systems utilizing explicit feedback have witnessed significant
advancements and widespread applications over the past years. However,
generating recommendations in few-shot scenarios remains a persistent
challenge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising
solution for addressing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, thereby
offering novel insights into tackling the few-shot scenarios encountered by
explicit feedback-based recommender systems. To bridge recommender systems and
LLMs, we devise a prompting template that generates user and item
representations based on explicit feedback. Subsequently, we integrate these
LLM-processed representations into various recommendation models to evaluate
their significance across diverse recommendation tasks. Our ablation
experiments and case study analysis collectively demonstrate the effectiveness
of LLMs in processing explicit feedback, highlighting that LLMs equipped with
generative and logical reasoning capabilities can effectively serve as a
component of recommender systems to enhance their performance in few-shot
scenarios. Furthermore, the broad adaptability of LLMs augments the
generalization potential of recommender models, despite certain inherent
constraints. We anticipate that our study can inspire researchers to delve
deeper into the multifaceted dimensions of LLMs's involvement in recommender
systems and contribute to the advancement of the explicit feedback-based
recommender systems field.

基于显式反馈的推荐系统在过去几年取得了显著进展并广泛应用，然而在少样本场景下生成推荐仍是一项持续挑战。近期，大语言模型（LLMs）展现出解决自然语言处理任务的潜力，这为应对显式反馈推荐系统面临的少样本问题提供了新思路。为搭建推荐系统与LLMs之间的桥梁，我们设计了一种提示模板，可根据显式反馈生成用户和项目表征。随后将这些经LLM处理的特征嵌入多种推荐模型，评估其在不同推荐任务中的重要性。消融实验与案例分析共同验证了LLMs处理显式反馈的有效性，表明具备生成与逻辑推理能力的LLMs能有效作为推荐系统组件，提升少样本场景下的性能。尽管存在固有局限，LLMs的广泛适应性仍增强了推荐模型的泛化潜力。我们期待本研究能启发学者深入探索LLMs参与推荐系统的多维可能性，推动基于显式反馈的推荐系统领域发展。
