原文摘要:
Machine learning models have achieved significant milestones in various
domains, for example, computer vision models have an exceptional result in
object recognition, and in natural language processing, where Large Language
Models (LLM) like GPT can start a conversation with human-like proficiency.
However, abstract reasoning remains a challenge for these models, Can AI really
thinking like a human? still be a question yet to be answered. Raven
Progressive Matrices (RPM) is a metric designed to assess human reasoning
capabilities. It presents a series of eight images as a problem set, where the
participant should try to discover the underlying rules among these images and
select the most appropriate image from eight possible options that best
completes the sequence. This task always be used to test human reasoning
abilities and IQ. Zhang et al proposed a dataset called RAVEN which can be used
to test Machine Learning model abstract reasoning ability. In this paper, we
purposed Vision Transformer Contrastive Network which build on previous work
with the Contrastive Perceptual Inference network (CoPiNet), which set a new
benchmark for permutationinvariant models Raven Progressive Matrices by
incorporating contrast effects from psychology, cognition, and education, and
extends this foundation by leveraging the cutting-edge Vision Transformer
architecture. This integration aims to further refine the machine ability to
process and reason about spatial-temporal information from pixel-level inputs
and global wise features on RAVEN dataset.

机器学习模型已在多个领域取得显著成就，例如计算机视觉模型在物体识别方面表现卓越，而自然语言处理领域如GPT等大语言模型已能实现类人流畅对话。然而抽象推理仍是这些模型面临的挑战——人工智能能否真正像人类一样思考？这仍是悬而未决的问题。瑞文渐进矩阵（RPM）作为评估人类推理能力的标准化工具，通过呈现八张图像组成的问题集，要求参与者发现潜在规则并从八个选项中选出最符合序列逻辑的图像，长期被用于人类推理能力与智商测试。张等人提出的RAVEN数据集为测试机器学习模型抽象推理能力提供了基准。本文提出的视觉Transformer对比网络基于先前结合心理学、认知学和教育学对比效应的对比感知推理网络（CoPiNet）——该工作曾为排列不变模型在瑞文渐进矩阵任务上设立新标杆，通过引入前沿的视觉Transformer架构进行扩展，旨在进一步提升机器从像素级输入处理时空信息及在RAVEN数据集上提取全局特征进行推理的能力。
