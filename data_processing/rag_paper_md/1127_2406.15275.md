# Cognitive Map for Language Models: Optimal Planning via Verbally Representing the World Model

原文摘要:
Language models' ability to extrapolate learned behaviors to novel, more
complex environments beyond their training scope is highly unknown. This study
introduces a path planning task in a textualized Gridworld to probe language
models' extrapolation capabilities. We show that conventional approaches,
including next token prediction and Chain of Thought (CoT) finetuning, fail to
extrapolate in larger, unseen environments. Inspired by human cognition and
dual process theory, we propose cognitive maps for path planning, a novel CoT
framework that simulates humanlike mental representations. Our experiments show
that cognitive maps not only enhance extrapolation to unseen environments but
also exhibit humanlike characteristics through structured mental simulation and
rapid adaptation. Our finding that these cognitive maps require specialized
training schemes and cannot be induced through simple prompting opens up
important questions about developing general-purpose cognitive maps in language
models. Our comparison with exploration-based methods further illuminates the
complementary strengths of offline planning and online exploration.

语言模型将习得行为外推至训练范围之外的全新、更复杂环境的能力尚不明确。本研究通过文本化网格世界中的路径规划任务，探究语言模型的外推能力。实验表明，包括下一词预测和思维链微调在内的传统方法在更大规模的未知环境中均失效。受人类认知与双过程理论启发，我们提出用于路径规划的认知地图——一种模拟人类心理表征的新型思维链框架。实验证明认知地图不仅能提升对未知环境的外推性能，还通过结构化心理模拟和快速适应展现出类人特征。研究发现这些认知地图需要专门训练方案，无法通过简单提示诱导产生，这为开发语言模型中通用认知地图提出了重要命题。与基于探索方法的对比进一步揭示了离线规划与在线探索的互补优势。
