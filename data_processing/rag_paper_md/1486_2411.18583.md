原文摘要:
This research presents and compares multiple approaches to automate the
generation of literature reviews using several Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a Large Language
Model (LLM). The ever-increasing number of research articles provides a huge
challenge for manual literature review. It has resulted in an increased demand
for automation. Developing a system capable of automatically generating the
literature reviews from only the PDF files as input is the primary objective of
this research work. The effectiveness of several Natural Language Processing
(NLP) strategies, such as the frequency-based method (spaCy), the transformer
model (Simple T5), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Large Language
Model (GPT-3.5-turbo), is evaluated to meet the primary objective. The SciTLDR
dataset is chosen for this research experiment and three distinct techniques
are utilized to implement three different systems for auto-generating the
literature reviews. The ROUGE scores are used for the evaluation of all three
systems. Based on the evaluation, the Large Language Model GPT-3.5-turbo
achieved the highest ROUGE-1 score, 0.364. The transformer model comes in
second place and spaCy is at the last position. Finally, a graphical user
interface is created for the best system based on the large language model.

本研究提出并比较了多种自动化生成文献综述的方法，采用自然语言处理（NLP）技术和基于大型语言模型（LLM）的检索增强生成（RAG）策略。随着研究论文数量的持续激增，传统人工文献综述面临巨大挑战，这促使对自动化技术的需求日益增长。本研究的核心目标是开发一个仅需PDF文件作为输入即可自动生成文献综述的系统。为实现该目标，我们评估了多种NLP策略的有效性，包括基于频率的方法（spaCy）、Transformer模型（Simple T5）以及结合大型语言模型（GPT-3.5-turbo）的检索增强生成技术。实验选用SciTLDR数据集，通过三种不同技术构建了自动化文献综述生成系统。所有系统均采用ROUGE评分进行评估，结果显示大型语言模型GPT-3.5-turbo以0.364的ROUGE-1得分位居榜首，Transformer模型次之，spaCy方法表现最弱。最终，我们为表现最优的大型语言模型系统开发了图形用户界面。
