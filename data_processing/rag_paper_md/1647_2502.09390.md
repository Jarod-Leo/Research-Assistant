原文摘要:
In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing, Large Language
Models (LLMs) are tasked with increasingly complex reasoning challenges.
Traditional methods like chain-of-thought prompting have shown promise but
often fall short in fully leveraging a model's reasoning capabilities. This
paper introduces SQuARE (Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine), a
novel prompting technique designed to improve reasoning through a
self-interrogation paradigm. Building upon CoT frameworks, SQuARE prompts
models to generate and resolve multiple auxiliary questions before tackling the
main query, promoting a more thorough exploration of various aspects of a
topic. Our expansive evaluations, conducted with Llama 3 and GPT-4o models
across multiple question-answering datasets, demonstrate that SQuARE
significantly surpasses traditional CoT prompts and existing
rephrase-and-respond methods. By systematically decomposing queries, SQuARE
advances LLM capabilities in reasoning tasks. The code is publicly available at

在自然语言处理这一快速发展的领域中，大型语言模型（LLMs）正面临日益复杂的推理挑战。传统方法如思维链提示（chain-of-thought prompting）虽展现出潜力，但往往难以充分释放模型的推理潜能。本文提出SQuARE（序列问答推理引擎），这是一种通过自我提问范式提升推理能力的新型提示技术。该技术在思维链框架基础上，引导模型在解答主问题前先生成并解决多个辅助问题，从而实现对主题各维度的深入探索。我们基于Llama 3和GPT-4o模型在多个问答数据集上的大规模评估表明，SQuARE显著优于传统思维链提示及现有重述应答方法。通过系统化分解查询，该技术推动了大型语言模型在推理任务中的能力边界。相关代码已开源：https://github.com/IntelLabs/RAG-FiT/tree/square。
