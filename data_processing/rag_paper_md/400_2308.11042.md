原文摘要:
System-on-Chips (SoCs) form the crux of modern computing systems. SoCs enable
high-level integration through the utilization of multiple Intellectual
Property (IP) cores. However, the integration of multiple IP cores also
presents unique challenges owing to their inherent vulnerabilities, thereby
compromising the security of the entire system. Hence, it is imperative to
perform hardware security validation to address these concerns. The efficiency
of this validation procedure is contingent on the quality of the SoC security
properties provided. However, generating security properties with traditional
approaches often requires expert intervention and is limited to a few IPs,
thereby resulting in a time-consuming and non-robust process. To address this
issue, we, for the first time, propose a novel and automated Natural Language
Processing (NLP)-based Security Property Generator (NSPG). Specifically, our
approach utilizes hardware documentation in order to propose the first hardware
security-specific language model, HS-BERT, for extracting security properties
dedicated to hardware design. To evaluate our proposed technique, we trained
the HS-BERT model using sentences from RISC-V, OpenRISC, MIPS, OpenSPARC, and
OpenTitan SoC documentation. When assessedb on five untrained OpenTitan
hardware IP documents, NSPG was able to extract 326 security properties from
1723 sentences. This, in turn, aided in identifying eight security bugs in the
OpenTitan SoC design presented in the hardware hacking competition, Hack@DAC
2022.

片上系统（SoC）是现代计算系统的核心。通过集成多个知识产权（IP）核，SoC实现了高度集成化。然而，这些IP核固有的安全漏洞也给整个系统带来了独特挑战，可能危及系统安全性。因此，必须进行硬件安全验证以解决这些问题。验证效率取决于所提供的SoC安全属性质量，但传统方法生成安全属性通常需要专家介入且仅适用于少数IP核，导致流程耗时且缺乏鲁棒性。

为此，我们首次提出了一种基于自然语言处理（NLP）的自动化安全属性生成器NSPG。该方法利用硬件文档，构建了首个面向硬件安全的专用语言模型HS-BERT，用于提取硬件设计相关的安全属性。在评估阶段，我们使用RISC-V、OpenRISC、MIPS、OpenSPARC和OpenTitan SoC文档中的语句对HS-BERT模型进行训练。在五份未经训练的OpenTitan硬件IP文档测试中，NSPG成功从1723个句子中提取出326条安全属性，进而帮助发现了Hack@DAC 2022硬件黑客竞赛中OpenTitan SoC设计的8个安全漏洞。
