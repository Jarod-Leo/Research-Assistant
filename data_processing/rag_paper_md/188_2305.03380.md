原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
by generating human-like text and images from textual input. However, their
potential to generate complex 2D/3D visualizations has been largely unexplored.
We report initial experiments showing that LLMs can generate 2D/3D
visualizations that may be used for legal visualization. Further research is
needed for complex 2D visualizations and 3D scenes. LLMs can become a powerful
tool for many industries and applications, generating complex visualizations
with minimal training.

大型语言模型（LLMs）通过从文本输入生成类人文本与图像，彻底改变了自然语言处理领域。然而，其在生成复杂二维/三维可视化内容方面的潜力尚未得到充分探索。我们报告的初步实验表明，LLMs能够生成可用于法律可视化场景的二维/三维视图。针对复杂二维图形和三维场景的生成仍需进一步研究。只需少量训练，LLMs即可成为跨行业应用的强大工具，实现复杂可视化内容的生成。
