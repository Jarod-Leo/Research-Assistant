原文摘要:
Graphs have emerged as a natural choice to represent and analyze the
intricate patterns and rich information of the Web, enabling applications such
as online page classification and social recommendation. The prevailing
"pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine
learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However,
this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of
pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the
"negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training
adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in
prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the
potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an
alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to
homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To
bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework
to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural
networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that
integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the
aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT
introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the
complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the
performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.

图结构已成为表征和分析网络复杂模式与丰富信息的自然选择，支撑着网页分类、社交推荐等应用场景。当前图机器学习任务普遍采用"预训练-微调"范式，尤其在标记节点稀缺的情况下。然而，该方法存在预训练任务与下游任务目标不一致的问题，可能导致"负迁移"现象——即预训练获得的知识反而损害下游任务表现。自然语言处理领域兴起的提示学习热潮，启示了"预训练-提示"范式在图结构应用的潜力。但现有图提示技术仅适用于同质图，忽视了网络图固有的异质性。为此，我们提出HetGPT框架，通过后训练提示机制提升预训练异质图神经网络（HGNNs）的预测性能。其核心是创新性地设计了融合虚拟类别提示与异质特征提示的提示函数，将下游任务重构为与预训练任务相似的形式。此外，HetGPT引入多视角邻域聚合机制，有效捕捉异质图中复杂的邻域结构。在三个基准数据集上的大量实验证明，HetGPT能显著提升前沿HGNN模型在半监督节点分类任务中的表现。
