# Opportunities for Large Language Models and Discourse in Engineering Design

原文摘要:
In recent years, large language models have achieved breakthroughs on a wide
range of benchmarks in natural language processing and continue to increase in
performance. Recently, the advances of large language models have raised
interest outside the natural language processing community and could have a
large impact on daily life. In this paper, we pose the question: How will large
language models and other foundation models shape the future product
development process? We provide the reader with an overview of the subject by
summarizing both recent advances in natural language processing and the use of
information technology in the engineering design process. We argue that
discourse should be regarded as the core of engineering design processes, and
therefore should be represented in a digital artifact. On this basis, we
describe how foundation models such as large language models could contribute
to the design discourse by automating parts thereof that involve creativity and
reasoning, and were previously reserved for humans. We describe how
simulations, experiments, topology optimizations, and other process steps can
be integrated into a machine-actionable, discourse-centric design process.
Finally, we outline the future research that will be necessary for the
implementation of the conceptualized framework.

近年来，大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域的多项基准测试中取得突破性进展，其性能持续提升。这一技术突破已引发自然语言处理学界之外的广泛关注，并将对日常生活产生深远影响。本文聚焦核心问题：大型语言模型及其他基础模型将如何重塑未来产品开发流程？我们通过系统梳理自然语言处理领域最新进展与工程设计过程中信息技术的应用现状，为读者构建完整的认知框架。本文提出应将设计论述视为工程设计过程的核心要素，并主张将其转化为数字化载体。在此基础上，我们阐释了大型语言模型等基础模型如何通过自动化处理涉及创造力与逻辑推理的设计论述环节（这些传统上专属于人类的职能），从而赋能设计过程。我们详细论述了如何将仿真实验、拓扑优化等流程步骤整合至机器可执行、以论述为核心的设计体系中。最后，本文规划了实现该概念框架所需的未来研究方向。
