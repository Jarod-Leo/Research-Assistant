# Rewriting the Script: Adapting Text Instructions for Voice Interaction

原文摘要:
Voice assistants have sharply risen in popularity in recent years, but their
use has been limited mostly to simple applications like music, hands-free
search, or control of internet-of-things devices. What would it take for voice
assistants to guide people through more complex tasks? In our work, we study
the limitations of the dominant approach voice assistants take to complex task
guidance: reading aloud written instructions. Using recipes as an example, we
observe twelve participants cook at home with a state-of-the-art voice
assistant. We learn that the current approach leads to nine challenges,
including obscuring the bigger picture, overwhelming users with too much
information, and failing to communicate affordances. Instructions delivered by
a voice assistant are especially difficult because they cannot be skimmed as
easily as written instructions. Alexa in particular did not surface crucial
details to the user or answer questions well. We draw on our observations to
propose eight ways in which voice assistants can ``rewrite the script'' --
summarizing, signposting, splitting, elaborating, volunteering, reordering,
redistributing, and visualizing -- to transform written sources into forms that
are readily communicated through spoken conversation. We conclude with a vision
of how modern advancements in natural language processing can be leveraged for
intelligent agents to guide users effectively through complex tasks.

近年来，语音助手的使用率急剧上升，但其应用范围大多局限于音乐播放、免提搜索或物联网设备控制等简单功能。若要让语音助手引导用户完成更复杂的任务，需要哪些突破？本研究以食谱为例，通过观察12名参与者在家中使用尖端语音助手烹饪的过程，揭示了当前主流方案——朗读书面操作指南——存在的九大缺陷：包括模糊任务全景、信息过载、无法传达功能可见性等问题。语音指令尤其难以快速浏览的特性，使得这些问题更为突出。特别是Alexa语音助手既未能向用户呈现关键细节，也无法有效解答疑问。基于观察结果，我们提出语音助手"重写脚本"的八种策略：概括总结、路标指引、任务拆分、细节补充、主动协助、步骤重组、责任分配和可视化呈现，从而将书面内容转化为适合语音对话的传达形式。最后我们展望了如何利用自然语言处理技术的最新进展，使智能代理能有效引导用户完成复杂任务。
