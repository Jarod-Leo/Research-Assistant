# Large Language Models for Judicial Entity Extraction: A Comparative Study

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05786v1

原文摘要:
Domain-specific Entity Recognition holds significant importance in legal
contexts, serving as a fundamental task that supports various applications such
as question-answering systems, text summarization, machine translation,
sentiment analysis, and information retrieval specifically within case law
documents. Recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of Large Language
Models in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating their capability to
accurately detect and classify domain-specific facts (entities) from
specialized texts like clinical and financial documents. This research
investigates the application of Large Language Models in identifying
domain-specific entities (e.g., courts, petitioner, judge, lawyer, respondents,
FIR nos.) within case law documents, with a specific focus on their aptitude
for handling domain-specific language complexity and contextual variations. The
study evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art Large Language Model
architectures, including Large Language Model Meta AI 3, Mistral, and Gemma, in
the context of extracting judicial facts tailored to Indian judicial texts.
Mistral and Gemma emerged as the top-performing models, showcasing balanced
precision and recall crucial for accurate entity identification. These findings
confirm the value of Large Language Models in judicial documents and
demonstrate how they can facilitate and quicken scientific research by
producing precise, organised data outputs that are appropriate for in-depth
examination.
