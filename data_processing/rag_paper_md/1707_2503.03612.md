原文摘要:
Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance,
increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its
growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what
financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We
explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language
models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment
measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced
natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly
enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and
greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how
BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured
sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and
LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment
interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive
transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor
sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By
exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we
provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in
finance.

金融情绪已成为金融领域中至关重要却又复杂的概念，日益广泛地应用于市场预测与投资策略。尽管其重要性不断提升，但如何准确定义金融情绪、理解其本质内涵并实现有效测量，仍是亟待解决的问题。本文深入探讨金融情绪的本质特征，并系统研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在其测度领域的应用贡献。通过梳理金融情绪测量的演进历程——从早期的市场指标法、词典分析法到现代自然语言处理技术，我们发现LLMs的出现显著提升了情绪分析的深度与精度，实现了对金融文本的语境化理解和精准情感提取。研究表明：基于BERT架构的RoBERTa、FinBERT等模型在结构化情绪分类任务中表现卓越，而GPT-4、OPT、LLaMA等GPT系模型则在金融文本生成与实时情绪解读方面优势显著。通过对比双向编码与自回归两种Transformer架构，本文揭示了它们在投资者情绪分析、算法交易及金融决策中的差异化应用价值。本研究通过解析金融情绪的本质及其在LLMs中的测度机制，为人工智能驱动的情绪分析在金融领域的深化应用提供了理论洞见。
