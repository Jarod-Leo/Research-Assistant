原文摘要:
Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, is a subfield of natural
language processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and extracting subjective
information in textual material. This can include determining the overall
sentiment of a piece of text (e.g., positive or negative), as well as
identifying specific emotions or opinions expressed in the text, that involves
the use of advanced machine and deep learning techniques. Recently,
transformer-based language models make this task of human emotion analysis
intuitive, thanks to the attention mechanism and parallel computation. These
advantages make such models very powerful on linguistic tasks, unlike recurrent
neural networks that spend a lot of time on sequential processing, making them
prone to fail when it comes to processing long text. The scope of our paper
aims to study the behaviour of the cutting-edge Transformer-based language
models on opinion mining and provide a high-level comparison between them to
highlight their key particularities. Additionally, our comparative study shows
leads and paves the way for production engineers regarding the approach to
focus on and is useful for researchers as it provides guidelines for future
research subjects.

观点挖掘，又称情感分析，是自然语言处理（NLP）的重要分支领域，专注于从文本材料中识别与提取主观信息。其核心任务包括判定文本的整体情感倾向（如积极或消极），以及识别文本中表达的具体情绪或观点，这一过程涉及先进的机器学习和深度学习技术。近年来，基于Transformer架构的语言模型凭借其注意力机制与并行计算优势，使得人类情感分析任务变得更为直观。相较于需要大量时间进行序列处理的循环神经网络，这类模型在语言任务中展现出强大性能，尤其擅长处理长文本场景。本文旨在研究前沿Transformer语言模型在观点挖掘任务中的表现特征，通过高层次模型对比揭示其核心特性。这项对比研究不仅为生产工程师指明了技术选型方向，也为学术界提供了未来研究课题的指导框架。
