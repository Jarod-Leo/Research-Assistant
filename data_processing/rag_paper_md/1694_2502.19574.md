原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various natural language
processing tasks, including their application to proteomics data to classify
protein fragments. In this study, we curated a limited mass spectrometry
dataset with 1000s of protein fragments, consisting of proteins that appear to
be attached to the endoplasmic reticulum in cardiac cells, of which a fraction
was cloned and characterized for their impact on SERCA, an ER calcium pump.
With this limited dataset, we sought to determine whether LLMs could correctly
predict whether a new protein fragment could bind SERCA, based only on its
sequence and a few biophysical characteristics, such as hydrophobicity,
determined from that sequence. To do so, we generated random sequences based on
cloned fragments, embedded the fragments into a retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) database to group them by similarity, then fine-tuned large language
model (LLM) prompts to predict whether a novel sequence could bind SERCA. We
benchmarked this approach using multiple open-source LLMs, namely the
Meta/llama series, and embedding functions commonly available on the
Huggingface repository. We then assessed the generalizability of this approach
in classifying novel protein fragments from mass spectrometry that were not
initially cloned for functional characterization. By further tuning the prompt
to account for motifs, such as ER retention sequences, we improved the
classification accuracy by and identified several proteins predicted to
localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and bind SERCA, including Ribosomal
Protein L2 and selenoprotein S. Although our results were based on proteomics
data from cardiac cells, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in
identifying novel protein interactions and functions with very limited
proteomic data.

大型语言模型（LLMs）在多种自然语言处理任务中展现出潜力，包括将其应用于蛋白质组学数据以分类蛋白质片段。本研究构建了一个有限规模的质谱数据集，包含数千个蛋白质片段，这些蛋白质片段似乎与心肌细胞内质网结合，其中部分片段已被克隆并表征其对内质网钙泵SERCA的影响。基于这一有限数据集，我们试图探究LLMs能否仅凭蛋白质序列及其衍生的少数生物物理特征（如疏水性）正确预测新蛋白质片段是否能结合SERCA。

为此，我们基于克隆片段生成随机序列，将片段嵌入检索增强生成（RAG）数据库进行相似性分组，并通过微调大型语言模型提示来预测新序列与SERCA的结合能力。我们采用多个开源LLMs（如Meta/llama系列）及Huggingface仓库常用嵌入函数对该方法进行基准测试。随后评估了该方法对质谱鉴定但未进行功能表征的新蛋白质片段的分类泛化能力。通过进一步调整提示以考虑内质网滞留序列等基序，我们将分类准确率提升，并鉴定出多个预测定位于内质网且结合SERCA的蛋白质，包括核糖体蛋白L2和硒蛋白S。

尽管研究结果基于心肌细胞的蛋白质组学数据，但该方法证明了LLMs在极有限蛋白质组数据下识别新型蛋白质相互作用和功能的潜力。
