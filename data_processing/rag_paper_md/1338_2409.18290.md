# Retrospective Comparative Analysis of Prostate Cancer In-Basket Messages: Responses from Closed-Domain LLM vs. Clinical Teams

原文摘要:
In-basket message interactions play a crucial role in physician-patient
communication, occurring during all phases (pre-, during, and post) of a
patient's care journey. However, responding to these patients' inquiries has
become a significant burden on healthcare workflows, consuming considerable
time for clinical care teams. To address this, we introduce RadOnc-GPT, a
specialized Large Language Model (LLM) powered by GPT-4 that has been designed
with a focus on radiotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer with advanced
prompt engineering, and specifically designed to assist in generating
responses. We integrated RadOnc-GPT with patient electronic health records
(EHR) from both the hospital-wide EHR database and an internal,
radiation-oncology-specific database. RadOnc-GPT was evaluated on 158
previously recorded in-basket message interactions. Quantitative natural
language processing (NLP) analysis and two grading studies with clinicians and
nurses were used to assess RadOnc-GPT's responses. Our findings indicate that
RadOnc-GPT slightly outperformed the clinical care team in "Clarity" and
"Empathy," while achieving comparable scores in "Completeness" and
"Correctness." RadOnc-GPT is estimated to save 5.2 minutes per message for
nurses and 2.4 minutes for clinicians, from reading the inquiry to sending the
response. Employing RadOnc-GPT for in-basket message draft generation has the
potential to alleviate the workload of clinical care teams and reduce
healthcare costs by producing high-quality, timely responses.

收件箱消息互动在医患沟通中扮演着关键角色，贯穿患者诊疗全过程（前期、中期及后期）。然而，回应这些患者咨询已成为医疗工作流程中的重大负担，消耗了临床护理团队大量时间。为此，我们推出RadOnc-GPT——一个基于GPT-4构建的专科大语言模型，通过高级提示工程针对前列腺癌放射治疗场景设计，专门用于辅助生成回复。该模型整合了来自全院电子健康记录（EHR）数据库和放射肿瘤专科数据库的患者数据。在158条历史收件箱互动记录上的测试显示，通过定量自然语言处理（NLP）分析和医护人员双盲评分研究，RadOnc-GPT在"清晰度"和"共情力"方面略优于人工团队，在"完整性"和"准确性"上表现相当。据估算，从阅读问询到发送回复，每条消息可为护士节省5.2分钟、为医生节省2.4分钟。采用RadOnc-GPT生成消息草稿，能通过提供高质量即时回复有效减轻临床团队工作负荷并降低医疗成本。
