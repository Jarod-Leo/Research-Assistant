原文摘要:
With the recent surge and exponential growth of social media usage,
scrutinizing social media content for the presence of any hateful content is of
utmost importance. Researchers have been diligently working since the past
decade on distinguishing between content that promotes hatred and content that
does not. Traditionally, the main focus has been on analyzing textual content.
However, recent research attempts have also commenced into the identification
of audio-based content. Nevertheless, studies have shown that relying solely on
audio or text-based content may be ineffective, as recent upsurge indicates
that individuals often employ sarcasm in their speech and writing. To overcome
these challenges, we present an approach to identify whether a speech promotes
hate or not utilizing both audio and textual representations. Our methodology
is based on the Transformer framework that incorporates both audio and text
sampling, accompanied by our very own layer called "Attentive Fusion". The
results of our study surpassed previous state-of-the-art techniques, achieving
an impressive macro F1 score of 0.927 on the Test Set.

随着社交媒体使用量的激增和指数级增长，审查社交媒体内容中是否存在仇恨内容变得至关重要。过去十年来，研究人员一直致力于区分煽动仇恨的内容与无害内容。传统研究方法主要集中于文本内容分析，但近期学术尝试已开始探索基于音频的内容识别。然而研究表明，仅依赖音频或文本内容可能收效甚微，因为最新趋势显示人们常在口语和书面表达中使用讽刺手法。为应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种融合音频与文本表征的语音仇恨内容检测方法。该方法基于Transformer框架，整合了音频与文本采样技术，并创新性地加入了我们自主研发的"注意力融合层"。实验结果表明，我们的模型性能超越了现有最先进技术，在测试集上取得了0.927的宏观F1分数。
