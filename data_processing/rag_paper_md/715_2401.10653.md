原文摘要:
With the recent surge and exponential growth of social media usage,
scrutinizing social media content for the presence of any hateful content is of
utmost importance. Researchers have been diligently working since the past
decade on distinguishing between content that promotes hatred and content that
does not. Traditionally, the main focus has been on analyzing textual content.
However, recent research attempts have also commenced into the identification
of audio-based content. Nevertheless, studies have shown that relying solely on
audio or text-based content may be ineffective, as recent upsurge indicates
that individuals often employ sarcasm in their speech and writing. To overcome
these challenges, we present an approach to identify whether a speech promotes
hate or not utilizing both audio and textual representations. Our methodology
is based on the Transformer framework that incorporates both audio and text
sampling, accompanied by our very own layer called "Attentive Fusion". The
results of our study surpassed previous state-of-the-art techniques, achieving
an impressive macro F1 score of 0.927 on the Test Set.

随着社交媒体使用量的激增和指数级增长，审查社交媒体内容中是否存在仇恨内容变得至关重要。过去十年间，研究人员一直致力于区分煽动仇恨的内容与非仇恨内容。传统方法主要集中于分析文本内容，但近期研究尝试已开始探索基于音频内容的识别。然而研究表明，仅依赖音频或文本内容可能效果不佳，因为最新趋势显示人们常在口语和书面表达中使用讽刺手法。为应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种结合音频与文本表征的仇恨言论识别方法。该方法基于Transformer框架，整合了音频和文本采样，并创新性地加入了我们设计的"注意力融合层"。研究结果超越了现有最优技术，在测试集上取得了0.927的宏观F1值这一令人瞩目的成绩。
