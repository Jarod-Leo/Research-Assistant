原文摘要:
As the foundation of current natural language processing methods, pre-trained
language model has achieved excellent performance. However, the black-box
structure of the deep neural network in pre-trained language models seriously
limits the interpretability of the language modeling process. After revisiting
the coupled requirement of deep neural representation and semantics logic of
language modeling, a Word-Context-Coupled Space (W2CSpace) is proposed by
introducing the alignment processing between uninterpretable neural
representation and interpretable statistical logic. Moreover, a clustering
process is also designed to connect the word- and context-level semantics.
Specifically, an associative knowledge network (AKN), considered interpretable
statistical logic, is introduced in the alignment process for word-level
semantics. Furthermore, the context-relative distance is employed as the
semantic feature for the downstream classifier, which is greatly different from
the current uninterpretable semantic representations of pre-trained models. Our
experiments for performance evaluation and interpretable analysis are executed
on several types of datasets, including SIGHAN, Weibo, and ChnSenti. Wherein a
novel evaluation strategy for the interpretability of machine learning models
is first proposed. According to the experimental results, our language model
can achieve better performance and highly credible interpretable ability
compared to related state-of-the-art methods.

作为当前自然语言处理方法的基石，预训练语言模型已展现出卓越性能。然而，预训练模型中深度神经网络的黑箱结构严重制约了语言建模过程的可解释性。通过重新审视语言建模中深度神经表征与语义逻辑的耦合需求，本研究提出"词-上下文耦合空间"（W2CSpace），在不可解释的神经表征与可解释的统计逻辑之间建立对齐处理机制，并设计聚类流程衔接词级与上下文级语义。具体而言，在词级语义对齐过程中引入具有可解释性的统计逻辑——关联知识网络（AKN）；针对下游分类器则采用上下文相对距离作为语义特征，这与当前预训练模型不可解释的语义表征存在本质差异。我们在SIGHAN、微博和ChnSenti等多类数据集上进行了性能评估与可解释性分析实验，其中首次提出了机器学习模型可解释性的新型评估策略。实验结果表明，相较于相关前沿方法，本语言模型既能实现更优性能，又具备高度可信的可解释能力。
