原文摘要:
Modern software systems are subjected to various types of uncertainties
arising from context, environment, etc. To this end, self-adaptation techniques
have been sought out as potential solutions. Although recent advances in
self-adaptation through the use of ML techniques have demonstrated promising
results, the capabilities are limited by constraints imposed by the ML
techniques, such as the need for training samples, the ability to generalize,
etc. Recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) open up new possibilities as
it is trained on massive amounts of data, potentially enabling the
interpretation of uncertainties and synthesis of adaptation strategies. In this
context, this paper presents a vision for using GenAI, particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of
architectural adaptation. Drawing parallels with human operators, we propose
that LLMs can autonomously generate similar, context-sensitive adaptation
strategies through its advanced natural language processing capabilities. This
method allows software systems to understand their operational state and
implement adaptations that align with their architectural requirements and
environmental changes. By integrating LLMs into the self-adaptive system
architecture, we facilitate nuanced decision-making that mirrors human-like
adaptive reasoning. A case study with the SWIM exemplar system provides
promising results, indicating that LLMs can potentially handle different
adaptation scenarios. Our findings suggest that GenAI has significant potential
to improve software systems' dynamic adaptability and resilience.

现代软件系统面临着由运行环境、上下文等因素引发的各类不确定性挑战。为此，自适应性技术被视为潜在的解决方案。尽管当前利用机器学习技术实现的自适应方法已展现出良好效果，但其能力仍受限于训练样本需求、泛化能力等机器学习固有约束。生成式人工智能（GenAI）的最新进展为此开辟了新路径——通过海量数据训练的GenAI（特别是大语言模型LLMs）有望实现不确定性的解析与适应策略的自主生成。本文提出一种创新构想：借鉴人类操作员的决策模式，利用LLMs强大的自然语言处理能力，使其能自主生成符合上下文情境的架构适应策略。这种方法使软件系统能够理解自身运行状态，并根据架构需求与环境变化实施精准调整。通过将LLMs集成到自适应系统架构中，我们实现了类人类推理的精细化决策机制。基于SWIM示例系统的案例研究表明，LLMs能有效处理多种适应场景，证实了生成式AI在提升软件系统动态适应性与韧性方面的巨大潜力。
