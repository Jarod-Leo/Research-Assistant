原文摘要:
The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into
corporate decision-making is a fundamental aspect of sustainable finance.
However, ensuring that business practices align with evolving regulatory
frameworks remains a persistent challenge. AI-driven solutions for
automatically assessing the alignment of sustainability reports and
non-financial disclosures with specific ESG activities could greatly support
this process. Yet, this task remains complex due to the limitations of
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts and
the scarcity of structured, high-quality datasets. In this paper, we
investigate the ability of current-generation LLMs to identify text related to
environmental activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their performance
can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning on a combination of original
and synthetically generated data. To this end, we introduce ESG-Activities, a
benchmark dataset containing 1,325 labelled text segments classified according
to the EU ESG taxonomy. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning on
ESG-Activities significantly enhances classification accuracy, with open models
such as Llama 7B and Gemma 7B outperforming large proprietary solutions in
specific configurations. These findings have important implications for
financial analysts, policymakers, and AI researchers seeking to enhance ESG
transparency and compliance through advanced natural language processing
techniques.

将环境、社会和治理（ESG）因素纳入企业决策是可持续金融的核心要素。然而，如何确保商业实践与不断演变的监管框架保持一致，始终是一项持续性挑战。基于人工智能的自动化评估解决方案——用于检测可持续发展报告和非财务披露与具体ESG活动的契合度——可为此提供重要支持。但由于通用大语言模型（LLMs）在专业领域的局限性，以及高质量结构化数据的稀缺，这项任务仍具复杂性。本文研究了当代大语言模型识别环境活动相关文本的能力，并证明通过原始数据与合成生成数据相结合的微调方法可显著提升其性能。为此，我们推出ESG-Activities基准数据集，包含1,325个根据欧盟ESG分类标准标记的文本片段。实验结果表明，基于ESG-Activities的微调显著提高了分类准确率，其中Llama 7B和Gemma 7B等开源模型在特定配置下表现优于大型商业解决方案。这些发现对金融分析师、政策制定者和AI研究者具有重要启示，有助于通过先进自然语言处理技术提升ESG透明度和合规性。
