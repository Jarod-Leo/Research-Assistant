# Theoretical and Methodological Framework for Studying Texts Produced by Large Language Models

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16740v1

原文摘要:
This paper addresses the conceptual, methodological and technical challenges
in studying large language models (LLMs) and the texts they produce from a
quantitative linguistics perspective. It builds on a theoretical framework that
distinguishes between the LLM as a substrate and the entities the model
simulates. The paper advocates for a strictly non-anthropomorphic approach to
models while cautiously applying methodologies used in studying human
linguistic behavior to the simulated entities. While natural language
processing researchers focus on the models themselves, their architecture,
evaluation, and methods for improving performance, we as quantitative linguists
should strive to build a robust theory concerning the characteristics of texts
produced by LLMs, how they differ from human-produced texts, and the properties
of simulated entities. Additionally, we should explore the potential of LLMs as
an instrument for studying human culture, of which language is an integral
part.

本文从计量语言学的视角，探讨了研究大语言模型（LLMs）及其生成文本时面临的概念、方法和技术挑战。研究基于一个区分模型基质与模型模拟实体的理论框架，主张对模型采取严格非拟人化的研究取向，同时审慎地将人类语言行为研究方法应用于模拟实体。自然语言处理研究者关注模型本身的结构、评估与性能优化方法，而作为计量语言学者，我们应致力于构建关于LLM生成文本特征、其与人类文本差异及模拟实体属性的坚实理论体系，并探索LLMs作为研究人类文化（语言是其核心组成部分）工具的潜在价值。
