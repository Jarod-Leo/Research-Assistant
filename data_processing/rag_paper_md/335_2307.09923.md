原文摘要:
Business Process Management (BPM) aims to improve organizational activities
and their outcomes by managing the underlying processes. To achieve this, it is
often necessary to consider information from various sources, including
unstructured textual documents. Therefore, researchers have developed several
BPM-specific solutions that extract information from textual documents using
Natural Language Processing techniques. These solutions are specific to their
respective tasks and cannot accomplish multiple process-related problems as a
general-purpose instrument. However, in light of the recent emergence of Large
Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, such a
general-purpose instrument with multiple applications now appears attainable.
In this paper, we illustrate how LLMs can accomplish text-related BPM tasks by
applying a specific LLM to three exemplary tasks: mining imperative process
models from textual descriptions, mining declarative process models from
textual descriptions, and assessing the suitability of process tasks from
textual descriptions for robotic process automation. We show that, without
extensive configuration or prompt engineering, LLMs perform comparably to or
better than existing solutions and discuss implications for future BPM research
as well as practical usage.

业务流程管理（BPM）旨在通过优化底层流程来提升组织活动及其成果。为实现这一目标，往往需要整合多源信息，包括非结构化文本文档。为此，研究者已开发出若干基于自然语言处理技术的BPM专用解决方案，用于从文本中提取信息。这些方案虽针对特定任务设计，却无法作为通用工具解决多重流程相关问题。然而，随着近期具备卓越推理能力的大语言模型（LLMs）的出现，这种多功能通用工具的构想已成为可能。本文通过将特定LLM应用于三项典型任务——从文本描述中挖掘命令式流程模型、从文本描述中挖掘声明式流程模型、以及基于文本描述评估流程任务对机器人流程自动化的适用性，系统论证了LLM处理文本相关BPM任务的能力。研究表明，在无需复杂配置或提示工程的情况下，LLM的表现与现有解决方案相当或更优，并探讨了其对未来BPM研究与实践应用的启示。
