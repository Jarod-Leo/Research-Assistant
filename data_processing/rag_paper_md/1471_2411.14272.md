原文摘要:
The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for helping decision-makers with
Climate Change action has recently been highlighted as a use case aligning with
a broader drive towards NLP technologies for social good. In this context,
Aspect-Based Summarization (ABS) systems that extract and summarize relevant
information are particularly useful as they provide stakeholders with a
convenient way of finding relevant information in expert-curated reports. In
this work, we release a new dataset for ABS of Climate Change reports and we
employ different Large Language Models (LLMs) and so-called Small Language
Models (SLMs) to tackle this problem in an unsupervised way. Considering the
problem at hand, we also show how SLMs are not significantly worse for the
problem while leading to reduced carbon footprint; we do so by applying for the
first time an existing framework considering both energy efficiency and task
performance to the evaluation of zero-shot generative models for ABS. Overall,
our results show that modern language models, both big and small, can
effectively tackle ABS for Climate Change reports but more research is needed
when we frame the problem as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) problem and
our work and dataset will help foster efforts in this direction.

利用自然语言处理（NLP）技术辅助决策者制定气候变化行动方案，近期作为"社会公益NLP技术"的重要应用场景受到广泛关注。在此背景下，基于方面的摘要生成（ABS）系统因其能从专家报告中提取并汇总关键信息，为利益相关方提供高效的信息检索途径而显得尤为重要。本研究发布了一个针对气候变化报告的ABS新数据集，并采用不同规模的大型语言模型（LLMs）和小型语言模型（SLMs）以无监督方式解决该问题。通过首次将兼顾能效与任务表现的评估框架应用于ABS领域的零样本生成模型，我们证明SLMs在性能差距可控的前提下能显著降低碳足迹。总体而言，研究表明无论模型规模大小，现代语言模型都能有效处理气候变化报告的ABS任务，但在构建检索增强生成（RAG）解决方案时仍需进一步探索。本研究成果及数据集将为该方向的研究提供重要支持。
