原文摘要:
The integration of natural language processing (NLP) technologies into
educational applications has shown promising results, particularly in the
language learning domain. Recently, many spoken open-domain chatbots have been
used as speaking partners, helping language learners improve their language
skills. However, one of the significant challenges is the high word-error-rate
(WER) when recognizing non-native/non-fluent speech, which interrupts
conversation flow and leads to disappointment for learners. This paper explores
the use of GPT4 for ASR error correction in conversational settings. In
addition to WER, we propose to use semantic textual similarity (STS) and next
response sensibility (NRS) metrics to evaluate the impact of error correction
models on the quality of the conversation. We find that transcriptions
corrected by GPT4 lead to higher conversation quality, despite an increase in
WER. GPT4 also outperforms standard error correction methods without the need
for in-domain training data.

自然语言处理（NLP）技术在教育应用中的整合已展现出显著成效，尤其在语言学习领域。近年来，众多开放式口语聊天机器人被用作对话伙伴，助力语言学习者提升技能。然而，当前面临的核心挑战在于识别非母语/非流利语音时的高词错误率（WER），这种识别错误会中断对话流畅性，使学习者产生挫败感。本研究探讨了GPT4在会话场景下自动语音识别（ASR）纠错中的应用。除WER外，我们创新性地引入语义文本相似度（STS）和后续响应合理性（NRS）指标，以评估纠错模型对会话质量的影响。实验表明：经GPT4修正后的转写文本虽WER有所上升，却能显著提升对话质量；且GPT4无需领域内训练数据即可超越传统纠错方法。
