原文摘要:
Our work advances an approach for predicting hate speech in social media,
drawing out the critical need to consider the discussions that follow a post to
successfully detect when hateful discourse may arise. Using graph transformer
networks, coupled with modelling attention and BERT-level natural language
processing, our approach can capture context and anticipate upcoming
anti-social behaviour. In this paper, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis
of this solution for hate speech detection in social networks, leading to
insights into where the method has the most impressive outcomes in comparison
with competitors and identifying scenarios where there are challenges to
achieving ideal performance. Included is an exploration of the kinds of posts
that permeate social media today, including the use of hateful images. This
suggests avenues for extending our model to be more comprehensive. A key
insight is that the focus on reasoning about the concept of context positions
us well to be able to support multi-modal analysis of online posts. We conclude
with a reflection on how the problem we are addressing relates especially well
to the theme of dynamic change, a critical concern for all AI solutions for
social impact. We also comment briefly on how mental health well-being can be
advanced with our work, through curated content attuned to the extent of hate
in posts.

本研究提出了一种预测社交媒体仇恨言论的创新方法，强调必须结合帖文后续讨论才能有效识别仇恨话语的萌发。通过图 Transformer 网络架构，结合注意力机制建模与 BERT 级别的自然语言处理技术，我们的方法能够捕捉上下文语境并预判潜在的反社会行为。本文针对社交网络仇恨言论检测方案开展了细致的定性分析，既揭示了该方法相较同类方案最具优势的应用场景，也明确了影响理想性能实现的挑战性情境。研究特别考察了当前社交媒体中渗透的各类帖文（包括仇恨图像的使用），这为模型扩展至多模态分析提供了完善路径。核心发现表明，对语境概念的推理机制研究为我们支持在线帖文的多模态分析奠定了良好基础。最后，我们探讨了该研究课题与动态变化主题的高度相关性——这对所有追求社会影响力的人工智能解决方案都至关重要，并简要论述了如何通过根据帖文仇恨程度定制内容来促进心理健康福祉。
