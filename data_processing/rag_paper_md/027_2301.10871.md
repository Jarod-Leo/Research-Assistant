原文摘要:
Our work advances an approach for predicting hate speech in social media,
drawing out the critical need to consider the discussions that follow a post to
successfully detect when hateful discourse may arise. Using graph transformer
networks, coupled with modelling attention and BERT-level natural language
processing, our approach can capture context and anticipate upcoming
anti-social behaviour. In this paper, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis
of this solution for hate speech detection in social networks, leading to
insights into where the method has the most impressive outcomes in comparison
with competitors and identifying scenarios where there are challenges to
achieving ideal performance. Included is an exploration of the kinds of posts
that permeate social media today, including the use of hateful images. This
suggests avenues for extending our model to be more comprehensive. A key
insight is that the focus on reasoning about the concept of context positions
us well to be able to support multi-modal analysis of online posts. We conclude
with a reflection on how the problem we are addressing relates especially well
to the theme of dynamic change, a critical concern for all AI solutions for
social impact. We also comment briefly on how mental health well-being can be
advanced with our work, through curated content attuned to the extent of hate
in posts.

本研究提出了一种预测社交媒体仇恨言论的创新方法，强调必须结合帖子的后续讨论才能有效识别仇恨话语的萌发。通过图神经网络与注意力机制建模的结合，辅以BERT级别的自然语言处理技术，我们的方法能够捕捉上下文信息并预判潜在的反社会行为。本文针对社交网络中的仇恨言论检测方案展开了细致的定性分析，既揭示了该方法相较同类技术的显著优势领域，也明确了其性能面临挑战的具体场景。研究特别考察了当前社交媒体中泛滥的各类有害内容（包括仇恨图像的使用），这为模型未来扩展至多模态分析提供了方向性指引。核心发现表明：对语境推理概念的聚焦使我们能够很好地支持网络帖子的多模态分析。最后，我们探讨了该研究课题与动态变化主题的高度相关性——这对所有追求社会影响的AI解决方案都至关重要，并简要论述了如何通过基于仇恨程度的内容筛选来促进心理健康福祉。
