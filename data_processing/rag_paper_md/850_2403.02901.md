# A Comprehensive Survey on Process-Oriented Automatic Text Summarization with Exploration of LLM-Based Methods

原文摘要:
Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), utilizing Natural Language Processing
(NLP) algorithms, aims to create concise and accurate summaries, thereby
significantly reducing the human effort required in processing large volumes of
text. ATS has drawn considerable interest in both academic and industrial
circles. Many studies have been conducted in the past to survey ATS methods;
however, they generally lack practicality for real-world implementations, as
they often categorize previous methods from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover,
the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has altered conventional ATS
methods. In this survey, we aim to 1) provide a comprehensive overview of ATS
from a ``Process-Oriented Schema'' perspective, which is best aligned with
real-world implementations; 2) comprehensively review the latest LLM-based ATS
works; and 3) deliver an up-to-date survey of ATS, bridging the two-year gap in
the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to
specifically investigate LLM-based ATS methods.

自动文本摘要（ATS）借助自然语言处理（NLP）算法，致力于生成简洁准确的摘要内容，从而大幅降低人工处理海量文本的工作量。该技术已在学术界与工业界引发广泛关注。尽管既往已有诸多针对ATS方法的综述研究，但这些研究多从理论角度对现有方法进行分类，缺乏实际应用层面的指导价值。此外，大型语言模型（LLM）的出现正在重塑传统ATS技术体系。本综述旨在实现三个目标：1）采用最贴合实际应用的"流程导向框架"视角，对ATS技术进行全面梳理；2）系统评述基于LLM的最新ATS研究成果；3）填补近两年研究空白，呈现ATS领域的最新进展。据我们所知，这是首篇专门探讨基于LLM的ATS方法的系统性综述。
