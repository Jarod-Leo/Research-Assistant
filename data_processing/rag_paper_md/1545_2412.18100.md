# EvoPat: A Multi-LLM-based Patents Summarization and Analysis Agent

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18100v1

原文摘要:
The rapid growth of scientific techniques and knowledge is reflected in the
exponential increase in new patents filed annually. While these patents drive
innovation, they also present significant burden for researchers and engineers,
especially newcomers. To avoid the tedious work of navigating a vast and
complex landscape to identify trends and breakthroughs, researchers urgently
need efficient tools to summarize, evaluate, and contextualize patents,
revealing their innovative contributions and underlying scientific
principles.To address this need, we present EvoPat, a multi-LLM-based patent
agent designed to assist users in analyzing patents through Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and advanced search strategies. EvoPat leverages multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs), each performing specialized roles such as
planning, identifying innovations, and conducting comparative evaluations. The
system integrates data from local databases, including patents, literature,
product catalogous, and company repositories, and online searches to provide
up-to-date insights. The ability to collect information not included in
original database automatically is also implemented. Through extensive testing
in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, we demonstrate that EvoPat
outperforms GPT-4 in tasks such as patent summarization, comparative analysis,
and technical evaluation. EvoPat represents a significant step toward creating
AI-powered tools that empower researchers and engineers to efficiently navigate
the complexities of the patent landscape.

科学技术的迅猛发展与知识体系的快速扩张，直接体现在每年专利申请量的指数级增长上。这些专利虽推动着创新浪潮，却也给科研人员尤其是行业新人带来了沉重负担。为摆脱在庞杂专利迷宫中人工检索趋势与突破点的低效工作，研究者亟需能对专利进行智能归纳、评估与背景分析的工具，以揭示其创新贡献与底层科学原理。

为此，我们推出EvoPat——基于多大型语言模型的专利分析智能体。该系统通过检索增强生成（RAG）技术与高级搜索策略，整合本地专利数据库、学术文献、产品目录、企业资料库及在线实时数据，构建动态知识网络。其创新性采用多LLM协同架构，各模型分别承担规划路径、创新点识别、对比评估等专项任务，并具备自动补全原始数据库外延信息的能力。

在自然语言处理领域的系统测试中，EvoPat在专利摘要生成、对比分析和技术评估等任务上均显著优于GPT-4。这一成果标志着人工智能辅助工具研发的重要突破，为科研人员高效驾驭专利迷宫提供了全新解决方案。
