# Web News Timeline Generation with Extended Task Prompting

原文摘要:
The creation of news timeline is essential for a comprehensive and contextual
understanding of events as they unfold over time. This approach aids in
discerning patterns and trends that might be obscured when news is viewed in
isolation. By organizing news in a chronological sequence, it becomes easier to
track the development of stories, understand the interrelation of events, and
grasp the broader implications of news items. This is particularly helpful in
sectors like finance and insurance, where timely understanding of the event
development-ranging from extreme weather to political upheavals and health
crises-is indispensable for effective risk management. While traditional
natural language processing (NLP) techniques have had some success, they often
fail to capture the news with nuanced relevance that are readily apparent to
domain experts, hindering broader industry integration. The advance of Large
Language Models (LLMs) offers a renewed opportunity to tackle this challenge.
However, direct prompting LLMs for this task is often ineffective. Our study
investigates the application of an extended task prompting technique to assess
past news relevance. We demonstrate that enhancing conventional prompts with
additional tasks boosts their effectiveness on various news dataset, rendering
news timeline generation practical for professional use. This work has been

新闻时间线的构建对于全面且情境化地理解事件随时间发展至关重要。该方法有助于识别孤立阅读新闻时可能被掩盖的模式与趋势。通过按时间顺序组织新闻，人们能更轻松追踪事件发展脉络、理解事件间的关联性，并把握新闻事件的深层影响。这在金融和保险等领域尤为实用——无论是极端天气、政治动荡还是健康危机，及时掌握事件动态对有效风险管理不可或缺。

尽管传统自然语言处理（NLP）技术取得了一定成效，但其往往难以捕捉领域专家一眼即明的微妙关联，阻碍了更广泛的行业应用。大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步为解决这一难题提供了新契机。然而直接使用LLMs生成时间线往往收效甚微。本研究探索了扩展任务提示技术在历史新闻相关性评估中的应用，证实通过附加任务增强传统提示模板可显著提升其在各类新闻数据集上的表现，使专业级新闻时间线生成成为可能。
