原文摘要:
Significant advancements have been made in one of the most critical branches
of artificial intelligence: natural language processing (NLP). These
advancements are exemplified by the remarkable success of OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4
and the recent release of GPT-4.5, which have sparked a global surge of
interest akin to an NLP gold rush. In this article, we offer our perspective on
the development and application of NLP and large language models (LLMs) in
materials science. We begin by presenting an overview of recent advancements in
NLP within the broader scientific landscape, with a particular focus on their
relevance to materials science. Next, we examine how NLP can facilitate the
understanding and design of novel materials and its potential integration with
other methodologies. To highlight key challenges and opportunities, we delve
into three specific topics: (i) the limitations of LLMs and their implications
for materials science applications, (ii) the creation of a fully automated
materials discovery pipeline, and (iii) the potential of GPT-like tools to
synthesize existing knowledge and aid in the design of sustainable materials.
