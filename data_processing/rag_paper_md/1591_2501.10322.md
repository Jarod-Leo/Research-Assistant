原文摘要:
Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing, breaking
text into units that computational models can process. While learned subword
tokenizers have become the de-facto standard, they present challenges such as
large vocabularies, limited adaptability to new domains or languages, and
sensitivity to spelling errors and variations. To overcome these limitations,
we investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language
modelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a
lightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word
embeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded
back into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains
the sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on
a rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion
parameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task
performance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly
greater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued
pretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as
fast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of
its previously learned knowledge. Hierarchical transformers pave the way for
NLP systems that are more robust, flexible, and generalizable across languages
and domains.

分词是自然语言处理的基础步骤，将文本分解为计算模型可处理的单元。尽管基于学习的子词分词器已成为事实标准，但它们仍面临诸多挑战：词汇表规模庞大、对新领域或语言的适应能力有限、对拼写错误及变体敏感。为突破这些限制，我们研究了一种结合字符级与词级处理的层次化自回归语言建模架构。该架构采用轻量级字符编码器将字符序列转换为词向量，经由词级主干模型处理后，再通过紧凑的字符解码器还原为字符。这种方法既保留了词级分词的序列压缩优势，又无需依赖固定的事先定义词汇表。我们在70亿参数规模下的实验表明，层次化Transformer模型在下游任务性能上媲美基于子词分词器的模型，同时对输入扰动展现出显著更强的鲁棒性。此外，在跨域语言持续预训练中，我们的模型训练速度提升近两倍，在目标语言上表现更优，并能更好地保留已习得知识。层次化Transformer为构建跨语言、跨领域且更具鲁棒性、灵活性和泛化能力的NLP系统开辟了新路径。
