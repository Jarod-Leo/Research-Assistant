原文摘要:
Autoregressive models have demonstrated great performance in natural language
processing (NLP) with impressive scalability, adaptability and
generalizability. Inspired by their notable success in NLP field,
autoregressive models have been intensively investigated recently for computer
vision, which perform next-token predictions by representing visual data as
visual tokens and enables autoregressive modelling for a wide range of vision
tasks, ranging from visual generation and visual understanding to the very
recent multimodal generation that unifies visual generation and understanding
with a single autoregressive model. This paper provides a systematic review of
vision autoregressive models, including the development of a taxonomy of
existing methods and highlighting their major contributions, strengths, and
limitations, covering various vision tasks such as image generation, video
generation, image editing, motion generation, medical image analysis, 3D
generation, robotic manipulation, unified multimodal generation, etc. Besides,
we investigate and analyze the latest advancements in autoregressive models,
including thorough benchmarking and discussion of existing methods across
various evaluation datasets. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising
directions for future research, offering a roadmap to guide further
advancements in vision autoregressive models.
