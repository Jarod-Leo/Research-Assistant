# Large Language Models on the Chessboard: A Study on ChatGPT's Formal Language Comprehension and Complex Reasoning Skills

原文摘要:
While large language models have made strides in natural language processing,
their proficiency in complex reasoning tasks requiring formal language
comprehension, such as chess, remains less investigated. This paper probes the
performance of ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model by OpenAI in tackling
such complex reasoning tasks, using chess as a case study. Through robust
metrics examining both the legality and quality of moves, we assess ChatGPT's
understanding of the chessboard, adherence to chess rules, and strategic
decision-making abilities. Our evaluation identifies limitations within
ChatGPT's attention mechanism that affect its formal language comprehension and
uncovers the model's underdeveloped self-regulation abilities. Our study also
reveals ChatGPT's propensity for a coherent strategy in its gameplay and a
noticeable uptick in decision-making assertiveness when the model is presented
with a greater volume of natural language or possesses a more lucid
understanding of the state of the chessboard. These findings contribute to the
growing exploration of language models' abilities beyond natural language
processing, providing valuable information for future research towards models
demonstrating human-like cognitive abilities.

尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但其在需要形式化语言理解的复杂推理任务（例如国际象棋）中的表现仍缺乏深入研究。本文以国际象棋为研究案例，探究了OpenAI开发的先进语言模型ChatGPT处理此类复杂推理任务的能力。通过采用同时检验棋步合法性与决策质量的综合评估指标，我们系统考察了ChatGPT对棋盘状态的认知、象棋规则的遵循程度以及战略决策能力。研究发现：ChatGPT的注意力机制存在影响其形式化语言理解的局限性，同时暴露出该模型自我调节能力尚未完善的特征。研究还表明，当模型接收更多自然语言信息或对棋盘状态有更清晰认知时，其棋局策略会呈现更强的连贯性，且决策自信度显著提升。这些发现为拓展语言模型在自然语言处理之外的认知能力研究提供了新见解，也为未来开发具有类人认知能力的模型提供了重要参考依据。
