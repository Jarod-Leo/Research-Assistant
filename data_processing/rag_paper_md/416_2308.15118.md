# Large Language Models on the Chessboard: A Study on ChatGPT's Formal Language Comprehension and Complex Reasoning Skills

原文摘要:
While large language models have made strides in natural language processing,
their proficiency in complex reasoning tasks requiring formal language
comprehension, such as chess, remains less investigated. This paper probes the
performance of ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model by OpenAI in tackling
such complex reasoning tasks, using chess as a case study. Through robust
metrics examining both the legality and quality of moves, we assess ChatGPT's
understanding of the chessboard, adherence to chess rules, and strategic
decision-making abilities. Our evaluation identifies limitations within
ChatGPT's attention mechanism that affect its formal language comprehension and
uncovers the model's underdeveloped self-regulation abilities. Our study also
reveals ChatGPT's propensity for a coherent strategy in its gameplay and a
noticeable uptick in decision-making assertiveness when the model is presented
with a greater volume of natural language or possesses a more lucid
understanding of the state of the chessboard. These findings contribute to the
growing exploration of language models' abilities beyond natural language
processing, providing valuable information for future research towards models
demonstrating human-like cognitive abilities.

尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但其在需要形式语言理解的复杂推理任务（如国际象棋）中的表现仍缺乏深入研究。本文以国际象棋为案例，探究了OpenAI开发的先进语言模型ChatGPT处理此类复杂推理任务的能力。通过采用严谨的评估指标，从棋步合法性和决策质量两个维度，我们系统考察了ChatGPT对棋盘状态的认知、规则遵循能力及战略决策水平。研究发现，ChatGPT的注意力机制存在影响形式语言理解的局限性，同时暴露出该模型自我调节能力的不足。研究还表明：当输入更多自然语言信息或对棋盘状态有更清晰认知时，ChatGPT会展现出更强的策略连贯性，其决策自信度也呈现显著提升。这些发现为拓展语言模型在非自然语言处理领域的能力研究提供了新见解，对开发具有类人认知能力的下一代模型具有重要参考价值。
