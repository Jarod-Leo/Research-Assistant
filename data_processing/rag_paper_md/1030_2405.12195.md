原文摘要:
As Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and analogous systems,
continue to advance, their robust natural language processing capabilities and
diverse applications have garnered considerable attention. Nonetheless, despite
the increasing acknowledgment of the convergence of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) and Software Engineering (SE), there is a lack of studies involving the
impact of this convergence on the practices and perceptions of software
developers. Understanding how software developers perceive and engage with AI
tools, such as ChatGPT, is essential for elucidating the impact and potential
challenges of incorporating AI-driven tools in the software development
process. In this paper, we conducted a survey with 207 software developers to
understand the impact of ChatGPT on software quality, productivity, and job
satisfaction. Furthermore, the study delves into developers' expectations
regarding future adaptations of ChatGPT, concerns about potential job
displacement, and perspectives on regulatory interventions.
