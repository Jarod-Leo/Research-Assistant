原文摘要:
With the boom of e-commerce and web applications, recommender systems have
become an important part of our daily lives, providing personalized
recommendations based on the user's preferences. Although deep neural networks
(DNNs) have made significant progress in improving recommendation systems by
simulating the interaction between users and items and incorporating their
textual information, these DNN-based approaches still have some limitations,
such as the difficulty of effectively understanding users' interests and
capturing textual information. It is not possible to generalize to different
seen/unseen recommendation scenarios and reason about their predictions. At the
same time, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), represented by
ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing
(NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) due to their superior capabilities in
the basic tasks of language understanding and generation, and their impressive
generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent research has
sought to harness the power of LLM to improve recommendation systems. Given the
rapid development of this research direction in the field of recommendation
systems, there is an urgent need for a systematic review of existing LLM-driven
recommendation systems for researchers and practitioners in related fields to
gain insight into. More specifically, we first introduced a representative
approach to learning user and item representations using LLM as a feature
encoder. We then reviewed the latest advances in LLMs techniques for
collaborative filtering enhanced recommendation systems from the three
paradigms of pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we had a
comprehensive discussion on the future direction of this emerging field.

随着电子商务和网络应用的蓬勃发展，推荐系统已成为日常生活中不可或缺的一部分，它能够基于用户偏好提供个性化推荐。尽管深度神经网络（DNNs）通过模拟用户与物品的交互关系并融合其文本信息，在提升推荐系统性能方面取得了显著进展，但这些基于DNN的方法仍存在若干局限性——例如难以有效理解用户兴趣、捕捉文本深层语义、泛化至已知/未知推荐场景，以及无法对预测结果进行合理解释。与此同时，以ChatGPT和GPT-4为代表的大语言模型（LLMs）凭借其在语言理解与生成基础任务上的卓越表现，以及令人瞩目的泛化推理能力，正在彻底革新自然语言处理（NLP）和人工智能（AI）领域。这促使学界开始探索如何利用LLM的强大能力来改进推荐系统。

鉴于LLM驱动推荐系统这一研究方向在近年来的快速发展，相关领域的研究者与实践者亟需一份系统性的综述来把握当前研究进展。本文首先阐述了利用LLM作为特征编码器来学习用户与物品表征的代表性方法；继而从预训练、微调和提示学习三大技术范式出发，梳理了LLM增强协同过滤推荐系统的最新研究成果；最后对这一新兴领域的未来发展方向进行了全面探讨。
