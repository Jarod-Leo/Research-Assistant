原文摘要:
With the boom of e-commerce and web applications, recommender systems have
become an important part of our daily lives, providing personalized
recommendations based on the user's preferences. Although deep neural networks
(DNNs) have made significant progress in improving recommendation systems by
simulating the interaction between users and items and incorporating their
textual information, these DNN-based approaches still have some limitations,
such as the difficulty of effectively understanding users' interests and
capturing textual information. It is not possible to generalize to different
seen/unseen recommendation scenarios and reason about their predictions. At the
same time, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), represented by
ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing
(NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) due to their superior capabilities in
the basic tasks of language understanding and generation, and their impressive
generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent research has
sought to harness the power of LLM to improve recommendation systems. Given the
rapid development of this research direction in the field of recommendation
systems, there is an urgent need for a systematic review of existing LLM-driven
recommendation systems for researchers and practitioners in related fields to
gain insight into. More specifically, we first introduced a representative
approach to learning user and item representations using LLM as a feature
encoder. We then reviewed the latest advances in LLMs techniques for
collaborative filtering enhanced recommendation systems from the three
paradigms of pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we had a
comprehensive discussion on the future direction of this emerging field.

随着电子商务和网络应用的蓬勃发展，推荐系统已成为日常生活中不可或缺的一部分，它能够根据用户偏好提供个性化推荐。尽管深度神经网络（DNNs）通过模拟用户与项目的交互过程并融合文本信息，在改进推荐系统方面取得了显著进展，但这些基于DNN的方法仍存在若干局限性：难以有效理解用户兴趣、捕捉文本信息，无法泛化至不同可见/不可见的推荐场景，且缺乏预测可解释性。与此同时，以ChatGPT和GPT-4为代表的大语言模型（LLMs）凭借其在语言理解与生成基础任务上的卓越能力，以及令人瞩目的泛化推理能力，正在重塑自然语言处理（NLP）和人工智能（AI）领域。因此，近期研究开始探索如何利用LLM的强大能力来提升推荐系统性能。鉴于这一研究方向在推荐系统领域的快速发展，相关领域的研究者和实践者亟需一份系统性的综述来洞悉现有LLM驱动的推荐系统。具体而言，我们首先介绍了使用LLM作为特征编码器来学习用户和项目表征的代表性方法；继而从预训练、微调和提示学习三大范式出发，综述了LLM技术用于协同过滤增强推荐系统的最新进展；最后对这一新兴领域的未来发展方向进行了全面探讨。
