# Just Tell Me: Prompt Engineering in Business Process Management

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07183v1

原文摘要:
GPT-3 and several other language models (LMs) can effectively address various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation and text
summarization. Recently, they have also been successfully employed in the
business process management (BPM) domain, e.g., for predictive process
monitoring and process extraction from text. This, however, typically requires
fine-tuning the employed LM, which, among others, necessitates large amounts of
suitable training data. A possible solution to this problem is the use of
prompt engineering, which leverages pre-trained LMs without fine-tuning them.
Recognizing this, we argue that prompt engineering can help bring the
capabilities of LMs to BPM research. We use this position paper to develop a
research agenda for the use of prompt engineering for BPM research by
identifying the associated potentials and challenges.

GPT-3及其他多款语言模型（LMs）能有效应对包括机器翻译与文本摘要在内的多种自然语言处理（NLP）任务。近期，这些模型在业务流程管理（BPM）领域亦取得成功应用，例如用于预测性流程监控及从文本中提取流程信息。然而，此类应用通常需对语言模型进行微调，这不仅需要大量适配的训练数据，还存在其他限制条件。针对该问题，提示工程（prompt engineering）提供了一种可能的解决方案——无需微调即可充分利用预训练语言模型的潜力。基于这一认知，本文主张提示工程有助于将语言模型的能力引入BPM研究领域。我们通过系统梳理相关潜力与挑战，以本立场文件为基础构建了提示工程应用于BPM研究的研究框架与发展路径。
