原文摘要:
This perspective article aims at providing an outline of the state of the art
and future developments towards the integration of cutting-edge predictive
language models with BCI. A synthetic overview of early and more recent
linguistic models, from natural language processing (NLP) models to recent LLM,
that to a varying extent improved predictive writing systems, is first
provided. Second, a summary of previous BCI implementations integrating
language models is presented. The few preliminary studies investigating the
possible combination of LLM with BCI spellers to efficiently support fast
communication and control are then described. Finally, current challenges and
limitations towards the full integration of LLM with BCI systems are discussed.
Recent investigations suggest that the combination of LLM with BCI might
drastically improve human-computer interaction in patients with motor or
language disorders as well as in healthy individuals. In particular, the
pretrained autoregressive transformer models, such as GPT, that capitalize from
parallelization, learning through pre-training and fine-tuning, promise a
substantial improvement of BCI for communication with respect to previous
systems incorporating simpler language models. Indeed, among various models,
the GPT-2 was shown to represent an excellent candidate for its integration
into BCI although testing was only perfomed on simulated conversations and not
on real BCI scenarios. Prospectively, the full integration of LLM with advanced
BCI systems might lead to a big leap forward towards fast, efficient and
user-adaptive neurotechnology.

本文旨在概述当前最前沿的预测性语言模型与脑机接口（BCI）融合的研究现状及未来发展方向。首先系统梳理了从自然语言处理（NLP）模型到近期大型语言模型（LLM）的语言模型演进历程，这些模型在不同程度上推动了预测性书写系统的进步；其次归纳了既往整合语言模型的BCI应用案例；继而详述了将LLM与BCI拼写系统结合以提升通讯效率的少量探索性研究；最后探讨了LLM与BCI系统全面融合面临的技术挑战与局限。最新研究表明，LLM与BCI的结合有望显著改善运动或语言障碍患者及健康人群的人机交互体验。特别是基于并行化计算、通过预训练与微调学习的自回归Transformer模型（如GPT系列），相较于早期整合简易语言模型的系统，将大幅提升BCI通讯效能。在众多模型中，GPT-2虽仅在模拟对话场景（非真实BCI环境）中测试，但已展现出与BCI整合的卓越潜力。展望未来，LLM与先进BCI系统的深度整合或将在高速、高效、用户自适应的神经技术领域实现重大突破。
