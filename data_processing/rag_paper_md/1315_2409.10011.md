原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language
processing tasks, yet they are susceptible to generating inaccurate or
unreliable responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. In critical domains
such as health and medicine, these hallucinations can pose serious risks. This
paper introduces HALO, a novel framework designed to enhance the accuracy and
reliability of medical question-answering (QA) systems by focusing on the
detection and mitigation of hallucinations. Our approach generates multiple
variations of a given query using LLMs and retrieves relevant information from
external open knowledge bases to enrich the context. We utilize maximum
marginal relevance scoring to prioritize the retrieved context, which is then
provided to LLMs for answer generation, thereby reducing the risk of
hallucinations. The integration of LangChain further streamlines this process,
resulting in a notable and robust increase in the accuracy of both open-source
and commercial LLMs, such as Llama-3.1 (from 44% to 65%) and ChatGPT (from 56%
to 70%). This framework underscores the critical importance of addressing
hallucinations in medical QA systems, ultimately improving clinical
decision-making and patient care. The open-source HALO is available at:

大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中取得了显著进展，但其生成的回答可能存在不准确或不可靠的问题，这种现象被称为"幻觉"。在健康与医疗等关键领域，这类幻觉可能引发严重风险。本文提出HALO框架，通过专注于检测和缓解幻觉现象，提升医疗问答系统的准确性与可靠性。该框架利用LLMs生成给定查询的多种变体，从外部开放知识库检索相关信息以丰富上下文，并采用最大边际相关性评分对检索内容进行优先级排序，最终将优化后的上下文提供给LLMs生成答案，从而降低幻觉风险。结合LangChain的集成应用，该方案使得开源和商用LLMs（如Llama-3.1从44%提升至65%，ChatGPT从56%提升至70%）的准确率获得显著且稳健的提升。该框架凸显了解决医疗问答系统中幻觉问题的关键价值，有助于改进临床决策和患者护理。开源HALO项目地址：https://github.com/ResponsibleAILab/HALO。
