# Leveraging Large Language Models for Zero-shot Lay Summarisation in Biomedicine and Beyond

原文摘要:
In this work, we explore the application of Large Language Models to
zero-shot Lay Summarisation. We propose a novel two-stage framework for Lay
Summarisation based on real-life processes, and find that summaries generated
with this method are increasingly preferred by human judges for larger models.
To help establish best practices for employing LLMs in zero-shot settings, we
also assess the ability of LLMs as judges, finding that they are able to
replicate the preferences of human judges. Finally, we take the initial steps
towards Lay Summarisation for Natural Language Processing (NLP) articles,
finding that LLMs are able to generalise to this new domain, and further
highlighting the greater utility of summaries generated by our proposed
approach via an in-depth human evaluation.

本研究探讨了大型语言模型在零样本科普摘要生成中的应用。我们基于现实流程提出了一种创新的两阶段科普摘要框架，发现随着模型规模增大，该方法生成的摘要更受人类评审青睐。为确立零样本环境下使用大型语言模型的最佳实践，我们评估了其作为评审者的能力，发现它们能复现人类评审的偏好。最后，我们初步探索了自然语言处理（NLP）论文的科普摘要生成，证实大型语言模型能有效迁移至该新领域，并通过深入人工评估进一步验证了所提方法生成摘要的更高实用性。
