原文摘要:
The impact of research papers, typically measured in terms of citation
counts, depends on several factors, including the reputation of the authors,
journals, and institutions, in addition to the quality of the scientific work.
In this paper, we present an approach that combines natural language processing
and machine learning to predict the impact of papers in a specific journal. Our
focus is on the text, which should correlate with impact and the topics covered
in the research. We employed a dataset of over 40,000 articles from ACS Applied
Materials and Interfaces spanning from 2012 to 2022. The data was processed
using various text embedding techniques and classified with supervised machine
learning algorithms. Papers were categorized into the top 20% most cited within
the journal, using both yearly and cumulative citation counts as metrics. Our
analysis reveals that the method employing generative pre-trained transformers
(GPT) was the most efficient for embedding, while the random forest algorithm
exhibited the best predictive power among the machine learning algorithms. An
optimized accuracy of 80\% in predicting whether a paper was among the top 20%
most cited was achieved for the cumulative citation count when abstracts were
processed. This accuracy is noteworthy, considering that author, institution,
and early citation pattern information were not taken into account. The
accuracy increased only slightly when the full texts of the papers were
processed. Also significant is the finding that a simpler embedding technique,
term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), yielded performance close to
that of GPT. Since TFIDF captures the topics of the paper we infer that, apart
from considering author and institution biases, citation counts for the
considered journal may be predicted by identifying topics and "reading" the
abstract of a paper.

研究论文的影响力通常以引用次数衡量，其取决于科学工作质量之外的多种因素，包括作者声誉、期刊声望及机构背景等。本文提出一种结合自然语言处理与机器学习的方法，用于预测特定期刊内论文的影响力。我们重点关注与影响力相关的文本特征及研究主题，基于2012至2022年间ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces期刊的40,000余篇论文构建数据集。通过多种文本嵌入技术处理数据，并采用监督式机器学习算法进行分类：以年度引用量和累计引用量为指标，将论文划分为期刊内被引频次前20%的文献。

分析表明，生成式预训练转换器（GPT）在文本嵌入中表现最优，而随机森林算法在机器学习模型中展现出最佳预测能力。当处理论文摘要时，对累计引用量的预测准确率最高可达80%（判断论文是否属于被引前20%）。这一结果具有显著意义，因为模型未纳入作者、机构及早期引用模式等信息。全文处理仅使准确率略微提升。另一重要发现是，较简单的词频-逆文档频率（TFIDF）嵌入方法性能接近GPT——由于TFIDF能捕捉论文主题特征，我们推断：除考虑作者和机构偏差外，通过识别研究主题并"阅读"摘要内容，即可对该期刊论文的引用量进行有效预测。
