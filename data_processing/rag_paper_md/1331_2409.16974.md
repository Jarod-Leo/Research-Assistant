原文摘要:
There have been rapid advancements in the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) in recent years, greatly revolutionizing the field of natural
language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and
interact with human language. Therefore, in this work, we conduct a systematic
investigation of the literature to identify the prominent themes and directions
of LLM developments, impacts, and limitations. Our findings illustrate the
aims, methodologies, limitations, and future directions of LLM research. It
includes responsible development considerations, algorithmic improvements,
ethical challenges, and societal implications of LLM development. Overall, this
paper provides a rigorous and comprehensive overview of current research in LLM
and identifies potential directions for future development. The article
highlights the application areas that could have a positive impact on society
along with the ethical considerations.
