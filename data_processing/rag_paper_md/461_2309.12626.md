原文摘要:
Contract review is an essential step in construction projects to prevent
potential losses. However, the current methods for reviewing construction
contracts lack effectiveness and reliability, leading to time-consuming and
error-prone processes. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
revolutionizing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle with
domain-specific knowledge and addressing specialized issues. This paper
presents a novel approach that leverages LLMs with construction contract
knowledge to emulate the process of contract review by human experts. Our
tuning-free approach incorporates construction contract domain knowledge to
enhance language models for identifying construction contract risks. The use of
a natural language when building the domain knowledge base facilitates
practical implementation. We evaluated our method on real construction
contracts and achieved solid performance. Additionally, we investigated how
large language models employ logical thinking during the task and provide
insights and recommendations for future research.

合同审查是建设工程中防范潜在损失的关键环节，然而现有审查方法在效率与可靠性方面存在不足，导致流程耗时且易出错。尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理任务中展现出变革潜力，但其在专业领域知识处理与专项问题解决上仍存在局限。本研究提出一种创新方法，通过将建设工程合同知识注入大语言模型，模拟专业人员的合同审查过程。这种免调优方案通过融入建筑工程合同领域知识来增强语言模型的风险识别能力，且采用自然语言构建领域知识库便于实际应用。经真实工程合同测试验证，本方法展现出稳定性能。研究还探讨了大语言模型在任务中的逻辑推理机制，并为后续研究提供了方向性建议。
