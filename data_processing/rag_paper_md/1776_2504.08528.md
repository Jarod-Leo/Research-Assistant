# On The Landscape of Spoken Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08528v1

原文摘要:
The field of spoken language processing is undergoing a shift from training
custom-built, task-specific models toward using and optimizing spoken language
models (SLMs) which act as universal speech processing systems. This trend is
similar to the progression toward universal language models that has taken
place in the field of (text) natural language processing. SLMs include both
"pure" language models of speech -- models of the distribution of tokenized
speech sequences -- and models that combine speech encoders with text language
models, often including both spoken and written input or output. Work in this
area is very diverse, with a range of terminology and evaluation settings. This
paper aims to contribute an improved understanding of SLMs via a unifying
literature survey of recent work in the context of the evolution of the field.
Our survey categorizes the work in this area by model architecture, training,
and evaluation choices, and describes some key challenges and directions for
future work.

口语处理领域正经历从训练定制化、任务专用模型向采用并优化通用语音处理系统——口语模型（SLMs）的转变。这一趋势与（文本）自然语言处理领域向通用语言模型发展的进程相呼应。SLMs既包含语音的"纯粹"语言模型（即对标记化语音序列分布进行建模的模型），也涵盖将语音编码器与文本语言模型相结合的混合架构，这类模型通常同时支持语音和文本的输入或输出。该领域研究呈现高度多样性，涉及不同术语体系和评估框架。本文通过整合性文献综述，在学科演进背景下系统梳理近期成果，旨在深化对SLMs的理解。我们的综述从模型架构、训练策略和评估方法三个维度对现有研究进行分类，并指出未来研究的关键挑战与发展方向。
