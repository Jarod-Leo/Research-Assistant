原文摘要:
This paper presents a comprehensive examination of the impact of tokenization
strategies and vocabulary sizes on the performance of Arabic language models in
downstream natural language processing tasks. Our investigation focused on the
effectiveness of four tokenizers across various tasks, including News
Classification, Hate Speech Detection, Sentiment Analysis, and Natural Language
Inference. Leveraging a diverse set of vocabulary sizes, we scrutinize the
intricate interplay between tokenization approaches and model performance. The
results reveal that Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) with Farasa outperforms other
strategies in multiple tasks, underscoring the significance of morphological
analysis in capturing the nuances of the Arabic language. However, challenges
arise in sentiment analysis, where dialect specific segmentation issues impact
model efficiency. Computational efficiency analysis demonstrates the stability
of BPE with Farasa, suggesting its practical viability. Our study uncovers
limited impacts of vocabulary size on model performance while keeping the model
size unchanged. This is challenging the established beliefs about the
relationship between vocabulary, model size, and downstream tasks, emphasizing
the need for the study of models' size and their corresponding vocabulary size
to generalize across domains and mitigate biases, particularly in dialect based
datasets. Paper's recommendations include refining tokenization strategies to
address dialect challenges, enhancing model robustness across diverse
linguistic contexts, and expanding datasets to encompass the rich dialect based
Arabic. This work not only advances our understanding of Arabic language models
but also lays the foundation for responsible and ethical developments in
natural language processing technologies tailored to the intricacies of the
Arabic language.

本文全面考察了分词策略与词汇量对阿拉伯语模型在下游自然语言处理任务中表现的影响。研究聚焦于四种分词器在新闻分类、仇恨言论检测、情感分析和自然语言推理等任务中的效能，通过采用不同规模的词汇表，深入剖析了分词方法与模型性能之间的复杂关联。实验结果表明，结合Farasa形态分析的字节对编码（BPE）在多项任务中表现最优，印证了形态分析对捕捉阿拉伯语细微特征的重要性。但在情感分析任务中，方言特有的分词问题影响了模型效率。计算效率分析显示BPE+Farasa具有稳定性优势，证实了其实用价值。

研究发现，在保持模型规模不变的情况下，词汇量对模型性能影响有限，这一结论对词汇量-模型规模-下游任务关系的传统认知提出了挑战，强调需要深入研究模型规模与对应词汇量的关系，以实现跨领域泛化并减少偏差（尤其在方言数据集上）。论文建议优化分词策略以应对方言挑战，增强模型在多样化语言环境中的鲁棒性，并扩充数据集以涵盖丰富的阿拉伯语方言变体。本研究不仅深化了对阿拉伯语模型的理解，更为针对阿拉伯语特性开发负责任、符合伦理的自然语言处理技术奠定了基础。
