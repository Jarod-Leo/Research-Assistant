原文摘要:
This paper presents a comprehensive examination of the impact of tokenization
strategies and vocabulary sizes on the performance of Arabic language models in
downstream natural language processing tasks. Our investigation focused on the
effectiveness of four tokenizers across various tasks, including News
Classification, Hate Speech Detection, Sentiment Analysis, and Natural Language
Inference. Leveraging a diverse set of vocabulary sizes, we scrutinize the
intricate interplay between tokenization approaches and model performance. The
results reveal that Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) with Farasa outperforms other
strategies in multiple tasks, underscoring the significance of morphological
analysis in capturing the nuances of the Arabic language. However, challenges
arise in sentiment analysis, where dialect specific segmentation issues impact
model efficiency. Computational efficiency analysis demonstrates the stability
of BPE with Farasa, suggesting its practical viability. Our study uncovers
limited impacts of vocabulary size on model performance while keeping the model
size unchanged. This is challenging the established beliefs about the
relationship between vocabulary, model size, and downstream tasks, emphasizing
the need for the study of models' size and their corresponding vocabulary size
to generalize across domains and mitigate biases, particularly in dialect based
datasets. Paper's recommendations include refining tokenization strategies to
address dialect challenges, enhancing model robustness across diverse
linguistic contexts, and expanding datasets to encompass the rich dialect based
Arabic. This work not only advances our understanding of Arabic language models
but also lays the foundation for responsible and ethical developments in
natural language processing technologies tailored to the intricacies of the
Arabic language.

本文系统研究了分词策略与词汇表规模对阿拉伯语模型在下游自然语言处理任务中的性能影响。我们重点考察了四种分词器在新闻分类、仇恨言论检测、情感分析和自然语言推理等任务中的表现，通过多维度词汇表规模实验，深入解析了分词方法与模型性能之间的复杂关联。研究结果表明，结合Farasa形态分析器的字节对编码（BPE）在多数任务中表现最优，这凸显了形态分析对于捕捉阿拉伯语微妙特征的重要性。然而在情感分析任务中，方言特有的分词问题会影响模型效能。计算效率分析显示BPE+Farasa方案具有稳定性，证实了其实用价值。研究发现，在保持模型规模不变的情况下，词汇表大小对性能影响有限，这一结论对词汇量-模型规模-下游任务关系的传统认知提出了挑战，强调需要研究模型规模与对应词汇量的匹配关系以实现跨领域泛化，特别是在方言数据集上减少偏差。本文建议改进分词策略以应对方言挑战，增强模型在多样化语言环境中的鲁棒性，并扩充数据集以涵盖丰富的阿拉伯语方言变体。本工作不仅深化了对阿拉伯语模型的理解，更为针对阿拉伯语特性开发负责任、符合伦理的自然语言处理技术奠定了基础。
