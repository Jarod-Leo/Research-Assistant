# How Teachers Can Use Large Language Models and Bloom's Taxonomy to Create Educational Quizzes

原文摘要:
Question generation (QG) is a natural language processing task with an
abundance of potential benefits and use cases in the educational domain. In
order for this potential to be realized, QG systems must be designed and
validated with pedagogical needs in mind. However, little research has assessed
or designed QG approaches with the input from real teachers or students. This
paper applies a large language model-based QG approach where questions are
generated with learning goals derived from Bloom's taxonomy. The automatically
generated questions are used in multiple experiments designed to assess how
teachers use them in practice. The results demonstrate that teachers prefer to
write quizzes with automatically generated questions, and that such quizzes
have no loss in quality compared to handwritten versions. Further, several
metrics indicate that automatically generated questions can even improve the
quality of the quizzes created, showing the promise for large scale use of QG
in the classroom setting.

问题生成（QG）作为一项自然语言处理任务，在教育领域具有广泛的应用前景与潜在价值。要实现这一潜力，QG系统的设计与验证必须充分考虑教学需求。然而，目前鲜有研究基于真实教师或学生的实际需求来评估或设计QG方法。本研究采用基于大语言模型的QG方法，通过布鲁姆分类法确定学习目标来生成问题。这些自动生成的问题被用于多项实验，旨在评估教师在实际教学中的使用情况。结果表明：教师更倾向于使用自动生成的问题编写测验，且此类测验在质量上与人工编写的版本相比毫不逊色。此外，多项指标显示自动生成的问题甚至能提升测验质量，这为QG技术在教育场景中的大规模应用展现了广阔前景。
