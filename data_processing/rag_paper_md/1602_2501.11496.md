# Generative AI and Large Language Models in Language Preservation: Opportunities and Challenges

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11496v1

原文摘要:
Generative AI and large-scale language models (LLM) have emerged as powerful
tools in language preservation, particularly for near-native and endangered
languages. With the increasing reliance on technology for communication,
education, and cultural documentation, new opportunities have emerged to
mitigate the dramatic decline of linguistic diversity worldwide. This paper
examines the role of generative AIs and LLMs in preserving endangered
languages, highlighting the risks and challenges associated with their use. We
analyze the underlying technologies driving these models, including natural
language processing (NLP) and deep learning, and explore several cases where
these technologies have been applied to low-resource languages. Additionally,
we discuss ethical considerations, data scarcity issues, and technical
challenges while proposing solutions to enhance AI-driven language
preservation.

生成式人工智能与大规模语言模型（LLM）已成为语言保护领域的重要工具，尤其对濒危语言和接近消亡的语种具有显著价值。随着通信、教育和文化记录日益依赖技术手段，全球范围内遏制语言多样性急剧衰退的新机遇正在显现。本文探讨了生成式AI与LLM在濒危语言保护中的作用，同时揭示了相关应用存在的风险与挑战。我们解析了驱动这些模型的核心技术——包括自然语言处理（NLP）和深度学习，并考察了这些技术在低资源语言中的实际应用案例。此外，研究还涉及伦理考量、数据稀缺性难题及技术瓶颈，进而提出增强AI驱动语言保护效能的解决方案。
