原文摘要:
With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems
(RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing
personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender
systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side
information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in
understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information,
inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning
on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their
remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding
and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning
capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power
of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this
research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a
systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems,
to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding.
Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered
recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning,
and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to
harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations
of users and items. Then, we review recent techniques of LLMs for enhancing
recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and
prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss future directions in this
emerging field.

随着电子商务和网络应用的蓬勃发展，推荐系统已成为日常生活中不可或缺的组成部分，通过提供契合用户偏好的个性化建议来优化体验。尽管深度神经网络通过建模用户-物品交互和融合文本侧信息，在增强推荐系统方面取得了显著进展，但基于DNN的方法仍存在诸多局限——例如难以精准理解用户兴趣、无法充分捕捉文本侧信息、缺乏跨场景泛化能力以及预测结果可解释性不足等问题。与此同时，以ChatGPT和GPT4为代表的大型语言模型凭借卓越的语言理解与生成能力，以及惊人的泛化推理性能，正在引发自然语言处理和人工智能领域的革命性变革。这一趋势促使学界开始探索如何利用LLM的强大能力来改进推荐系统。鉴于该研究方向在推荐系统领域的快速发展，亟需一份系统性综述来梳理现有LLM赋能的推荐系统研究，为相关领域学者提供深度参考。为此，本文从预训练、微调和提示学习三大技术路径出发，对LLM赋能的推荐系统进行了全方位综述。具体而言，我们首先阐释了利用LLM（作为特征编码器）学习用户与物品表征的代表性方法；继而从预训练、微调和提示学习三大范式系统梳理了当前LLM增强推荐系统的最新研究进展；最后对这一新兴领域的未来发展方向进行了全面展望。
