原文摘要:
Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has gained significant
interest and attention since its launch in November 2022. It has shown
impressive performance in various domains, including passing exams and creative
writing. However, challenges and concerns related to biases and trust persist.
In this work, we present a comprehensive review of over 100 Scopus-indexed
publications on ChatGPT, aiming to provide a taxonomy of ChatGPT research and
explore its applications. We critically analyze the existing literature,
identifying common approaches employed in the studies. Additionally, we
investigate diverse application areas where ChatGPT has found utility, such as
healthcare, marketing and financial services, software engineering, academic
and scientific writing, research and education, environmental science, and
natural language processing. Through examining these applications, we gain
valuable insights into the potential of ChatGPT in addressing real-world
challenges. We also discuss crucial issues related to ChatGPT, including biases
and trustworthiness, emphasizing the need for further research and development
in these areas. Furthermore, we identify potential future directions for
ChatGPT research, proposing solutions to current challenges and speculating on
expected advancements. By fully leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we can
unlock its potential across various domains, leading to advancements in
conversational AI and transformative impacts in society.
