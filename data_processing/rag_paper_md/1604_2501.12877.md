原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in natural
language processing (NLP), showing a promising future of artificial generated
intelligence (AGI). Despite their notable performance in the general domain,
LLMs have remained suboptimal in the field of education, owing to the unique
challenges presented by this domain, such as the need for more specialized
knowledge, the requirement for personalized learning experiences, and the
necessity for concise explanations of complex concepts. To address these
issues, this paper presents a novel LLM for education named WisdomBot, which
combines the power of LLMs with educational theories, enabling their seamless
integration into educational contexts. To be specific, we harness
self-instructed knowledge concepts and instructions under the guidance of
Bloom's Taxonomy as training data. To further enhance the accuracy and
professionalism of model's response on factual questions, we introduce two key
enhancements during inference, i.e., local knowledge base retrieval
augmentation and search engine retrieval augmentation during inference. We
substantiate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several
Chinese LLMs, thereby showcasing that the fine-tuned models can generate more
reliable and professional responses.

大型语言模型（LLMs）已成为自然语言处理（NLP）领域的强大工具，展现出生成式人工智能（AGI）的广阔前景。尽管在通用领域表现卓越，LLMs在教育领域的应用仍存在局限，这源于该领域特有的挑战：需要更专业化的知识储备、提供个性化学习体验的能力，以及对复杂概念进行简明阐释的要求。为此，本文提出一款专为教育设计的新型LLM——WisdomBot，通过将语言模型与教育理论深度融合，实现其在教学场景中的无缝衔接。具体而言，我们基于布鲁姆教育目标分类学框架，采用自指导式知识概念与教学指令构建训练数据集。为提升模型在事实性问题回答中的准确性与专业性，我们在推理阶段引入双重增强机制——本地知识库检索增强与搜索引擎检索增强。通过在中国本土多款LLMs上的实证研究，验证了该方法能显著提升模型生成内容的可靠性与专业度。
