原文摘要:
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant
advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in
generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications
in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively
utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku
remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on
LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is
de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational
decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board,"
"understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while
en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The
results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of
move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces
pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play
training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.

近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）领域展现出显著进步，具备强大的生成、理解与推理能力，已广泛应用于教育、智能决策和游戏等领域。然而如何有效利用LLMs进行五子棋的策略规划与决策仍具挑战性。本研究旨在开发基于LLMs的五子棋AI系统，通过模拟人类下棋的学习过程，使系统能够理解并运用五子棋的策略逻辑进行合理决策。研究方法包括让模型实现"读盘"、"理解规则"、"策略选择"和"局面评估"等能力，并通过自我对弈与强化学习进行能力增强。结果表明，该方法显著提升了落子位置的选择质量，解决了非法位置生成问题，通过并行局面评估缩短了处理时间。经过大量自我对弈训练后，模型的五子棋博弈能力得到显著提升。
