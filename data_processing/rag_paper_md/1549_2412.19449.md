原文摘要:
This study proposes a knowledge distillation algorithm based on large
language models and feature alignment, aiming to effectively transfer the
knowledge of large pre-trained models into lightweight student models, thereby
reducing computational costs while maintaining high model performance.
Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method
introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the
intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the
student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context
modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task
loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention
alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level
information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were
comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language
processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close
to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as
perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline
models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance
improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that
the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression
method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage
requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be
further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal
feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible
and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning
models.
