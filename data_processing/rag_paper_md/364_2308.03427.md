原文摘要:
With recent advancements in natural language processing, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for various real-world
applications. Despite their prowess, the intrinsic generative abilities of LLMs
may prove insufficient for handling complex tasks which necessitate a
combination of task planning and the usage of external tools. In this paper, we
first propose a structured framework tailored for LLM-based AI Agents and
discuss the crucial capabilities necessary for tackling intricate problems.
Within this framework, we design two distinct types of agents (i.e., one-step
agent and sequential agent) to execute the inference process. Subsequently, we
instantiate the framework using various LLMs and evaluate their Task Planning
and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities on typical tasks. By highlighting key findings
and challenges, our goal is to provide a helpful resource for researchers and
practitioners to leverage the power of LLMs in their AI applications. Our study
emphasizes the substantial potential of these models, while also identifying
areas that need more investigation and improvement.

随着自然语言处理技术的快速发展，大语言模型（LLMs）已成为支撑各类现实应用的核心工具。然而在面对需要任务规划与外部工具协同的复杂场景时，其固有的生成能力仍显不足。本文首先构建了面向LLM智能体的结构化框架，系统阐述了解决复杂问题所需的关键能力。在该框架下，我们设计了两类执行范式不同的智能体（单步式与序列式）来实现推理过程。随后通过典型任务实例化验证，评估了不同LLMs在任务规划与工具调用（TPTU）方面的表现。通过揭示核心发现与现存挑战，本研究旨在为学术界和工业界提供实践参考，助力LLMs在AI应用中的价值挖掘。实验结果既验证了大语言模型的巨大潜力，也指出了亟待深入探索的改进方向。
