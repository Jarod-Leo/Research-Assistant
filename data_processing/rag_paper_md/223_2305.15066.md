原文摘要:
Large language models~(LLM) like ChatGPT have become indispensable to
artificial general intelligence~(AGI), demonstrating excellent performance in
various natural language processing tasks. In the real world, graph data is
ubiquitous and an essential part of AGI and prevails in domains like social
network analysis, bioinformatics and recommender systems. The training corpus
of large language models often includes some algorithmic components, which
allows them to achieve certain effects on some graph data-related problems.
However, there is still little research on their performance on a broader range
of graph-structured data. In this study, we conduct an extensive investigation
to assess the proficiency of LLMs in comprehending graph data, employing a
diverse range of structural and semantic-related tasks. Our analysis
encompasses 10 distinct tasks that evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in graph
understanding. Through our study, we not only uncover the current limitations
of language models in comprehending graph structures and performing associated
reasoning tasks but also emphasize the necessity for further advancements and
novel approaches to enhance their graph processing capabilities. Our findings
contribute valuable insights towards bridging the gap between language models
and graph understanding, paving the way for more effective graph mining and
knowledge extraction.
