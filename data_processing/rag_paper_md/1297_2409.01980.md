# Large Language Models for Anomaly and Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Survey

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01980v1

原文摘要:
Detecting anomalies or out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for
maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness
not only in natural language processing but also in broader applications due to
their advanced comprehension and generative capabilities. The integration of
LLMs into anomaly and OOD detection marks a significant shift from the
traditional paradigm in the field. This survey focuses on the problem of
anomaly and OOD detection under the context of LLMs. We propose a new taxonomy
to categorize existing approaches into two classes based on the role played by
LLMs. Following our proposed taxonomy, we further discuss the related work
under each of the categories and finally discuss potential challenges and
directions for future research in this field. We also provide an up-to-date
reading list of relevant papers.

检测异常或分布外（OOD）样本对于维护机器学习系统的可靠性与可信度至关重要。近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）凭借其卓越的理解与生成能力，不仅在自然语言处理领域表现突出，更在更广泛的应用场景中展现出强大潜力。将LLMs引入异常与OOD检测领域，标志着该领域研究范式的重大转变。本综述聚焦于LLMs框架下的异常与OOD检测问题，提出了一种新型分类法，将现有方法依据LLMs所承担的角色划分为两大类。基于该分类体系，我们系统梳理了各类别下的相关研究工作，并深入探讨了该领域未来研究面临的挑战与发展方向。同时提供了相关文献的最新阅读清单。
