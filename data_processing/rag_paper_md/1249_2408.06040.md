原文摘要:
In the rapidly evolving fields of natural language processing and computer
vision, Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) stands as a critical, yet
challenging task. The quest for models that can seamlessly integrate and
interpret multimodal data is more pressing than ever. Imagine a system that can
understand language with the depth and nuance of human cognition, while
simultaneously interpreting the rich visual context of the world around it.
  We present ARPA, an architecture that fuses the unparalleled contextual
understanding of large language models with the advanced feature extraction
capabilities of transformers, which then pass through a custom Graph Neural
Network (GNN) layer to learn intricate relationships and subtle nuances within
the data. This innovative architecture not only sets a new benchmark in visual
word disambiguation but also introduces a versatile framework poised to
transform how linguistic and visual data interact by harnessing the synergistic
strengths of its components, ensuring robust performance even in the most
complex disambiguation scenarios. Through a series of experiments and
comparative analysis, we reveal the substantial advantages of our model,
underscoring its potential to redefine standards in the field. Beyond its
architectural prowess, our architecture excels through experimental
enrichments, including sophisticated data augmentation and multi-modal training
techniques.
  ARPA's introduction marks a significant milestone in visual word
disambiguation, offering a compelling solution that bridges the gap between
linguistic and visual modalities. We invite researchers and practitioners to
explore the capabilities of our model, envisioning a future where such hybrid
models drive unprecedented advancements in artificial intelligence.

在自然语言处理与计算机视觉的快速发展领域中，视觉词义消歧（VWSD）是一项关键而富有挑战性的任务。当前，对能够无缝整合并解读多模态数据的模型需求比以往任何时候都更为迫切。设想这样一个系统：它既能以人类认知的深度和细微差别理解语言，又能同步解析周围世界丰富的视觉语境。

我们提出ARPA架构，该架构将大语言模型无与伦比的上下文理解能力与Transformer先进的特征提取能力相融合，再通过定制化的图神经网络（GNN）层来学习数据中复杂的关联与微妙差异。这一创新架构不仅为视觉词义消歧树立了新标杆，更通过发挥各组件协同优势，构建出可重塑语言与视觉数据交互方式的通用框架，确保即使在最复杂的消歧场景下也能保持强劲性能。通过系列实验与对比分析，我们揭示了该模型的显著优势，彰显其重新定义领域标准的潜力。

除架构优势外，我们的模型还通过实验增强手段表现卓越，包括精妙的数据增强与多模态训练技术。ARPA的推出标志着视觉词义消歧领域的重大突破，它提供的解决方案弥合了语言模态与视觉模态之间的鸿沟。我们诚邀研究者与实践者共同探索该模型的潜力，展望此类混合模型推动人工智能实现前所未有进步的未來。
