# An Empirical Study of OpenAI API Discussions on Stack Overflow

原文摘要:
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), represented by
OpenAI's GPT series, has significantly impacted various domains such as natural
language processing, software development, education, healthcare, finance, and
scientific research. However, OpenAI APIs introduce unique challenges that
differ from traditional APIs, such as the complexities of prompt engineering,
token-based cost management, non-deterministic outputs, and operation as black
boxes. To the best of our knowledge, the challenges developers encounter when
using OpenAI APIs have not been explored in previous empirical studies. To fill
this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study by analyzing 2,874
OpenAI API-related discussions from the popular Q&A forum Stack Overflow. We
first examine the popularity and difficulty of these posts. After manually
categorizing them into nine OpenAI API-related categories, we identify specific
challenges associated with each category through topic modeling analysis. Based
on our empirical findings, we finally propose actionable implications for
developers, LLM vendors, and researchers.

以OpenAI的GPT系列为代表的大型语言模型（LLM）快速发展，已深刻影响了自然语言处理、软件开发、教育、医疗、金融和科研等多个领域。然而，OpenAI API带来了不同于传统API的独特挑战，例如提示工程的复杂性、基于令牌的成本管理、输出的非确定性以及黑箱操作特性。据我们所知，目前尚未有实证研究探讨开发者在使用OpenAI API时面临的具体挑战。为填补这一空白，我们通过分析技术问答社区Stack Overflow上2,874条OpenAI API相关讨论，开展了首次系统性实证研究。首先量化了这些帖子的热度与难度特征，在人工将其归类为九大OpenAI API相关主题后，通过主题建模分析识别出每个类别下的具体挑战。基于实证发现，我们最终为开发者、LLM供应商和研究者分别提出了可操作的改进建议。
