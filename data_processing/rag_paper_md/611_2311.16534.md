原文摘要:
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has revolutionized numerous fields, yet
its integration with graph data, a cornerstone in our interconnected world,
remains nascent. This paper presents a pioneering survey on the emerging domain
of graph prompts in AGI, addressing key challenges and opportunities in
harnessing graph data for AGI applications. Despite substantial advancements in
AGI across natural language processing and computer vision, the application to
graph data is relatively underexplored. This survey critically evaluates the
current landscape of AGI in handling graph data, highlighting the distinct
challenges in cross-modality, cross-domain, and cross-task applications
specific to graphs. Our work is the first to propose a unified framework for
understanding graph prompt learning, offering clarity on prompt tokens, token
structures, and insertion patterns in the graph domain. We delve into the
intrinsic properties of graph prompts, exploring their flexibility,
expressiveness, and interplay with existing graph models. A comprehensive
taxonomy categorizes over 100 works in this field, aligning them with
pre-training tasks across node-level, edge-level, and graph-level objectives.
Additionally, we present, ProG, a Python library, and an accompanying website,
to support and advance research in graph prompting. The survey culminates in a
discussion of current challenges and future directions, offering a roadmap for
research in graph prompting within AGI. Through this comprehensive analysis, we
aim to catalyze further exploration and practical applications of AGI in graph
data, underlining its potential to reshape AGI fields and beyond. ProG and the
website can be accessed by

人工通用智能（AGI）已彻底革新众多领域，然而其与图数据——这一互联世界基石的融合仍处于起步阶段。本文针对AGI中的图提示技术这一新兴领域进行了开创性综述，系统探讨了利用图数据发展AGI应用的关键挑战与机遇。尽管AGI在自然语言处理与计算机视觉领域取得重大进展，其在图数据中的应用仍相对不足。本综述批判性评估了当前AGI处理图数据的现状，着重分析了图数据特有的跨模态、跨领域与跨任务应用挑战。

本研究首次提出理解图提示学习的统一框架，清晰界定了图领域中的提示标记、标记结构与插入模式。我们深入探究图提示的内在特性，揭示其灵活性、表达能力以及与现有图模型的交互机制。通过建立系统分类体系，对领域内100余项研究成果进行了层级化梳理，将其与节点级、边级和图级预训练任务相映射。

为推进图提示研究，我们同步开源了Python工具库ProG并搭建了配套网站。综述最后讨论了当前挑战与未来方向，为AGI中的图提示研究绘制了发展路线图。这项全面分析旨在促进AGI在图数据中的深入探索与实际应用，彰显其重塑AGI及相关领域的潜力。ProG工具库与网站可通过以下链接访问：\url{https://github.com/WxxShirley/Awesome-Graph-Prompt}与\url{https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG}。
