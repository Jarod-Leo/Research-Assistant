原文摘要:
Protein engineering is an emerging field in biotechnology that has the
potential to revolutionize various areas, such as antibody design, drug
discovery, food security, ecology, and more. However, the mutational space
involved is too vast to be handled through experimental means alone. Leveraging
accumulative protein databases, machine learning (ML) models, particularly
those based on natural language processing (NLP), have considerably expedited
protein engineering. Moreover, advances in topological data analysis (TDA) and
artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2,
have made more powerful structure-based ML-assisted protein engineering
strategies possible. This review aims to offer a comprehensive, systematic, and
indispensable set of methodological components, including TDA and NLP, for
protein engineering and to facilitate their future development.

蛋白质工程作为生物技术领域的新兴方向，在抗体设计、药物研发、粮食安全、生态保护等诸多方面具有变革性潜力。然而，其所涉及的突变空间过于庞大，仅凭实验手段难以全面探索。借助日益丰富的蛋白质数据库资源，机器学习（尤其是基于自然语言处理的方法）显著加速了蛋白质工程的进程。此外，拓扑数据分析技术的进步与AlphaFold2等基于人工智能的蛋白质结构预测突破，使得更强大的结构导向型机器学习辅助策略成为可能。本综述旨在为蛋白质工程领域提供一套全面、系统且不可或缺的方法学组件（包括拓扑数据分析和自然语言处理等技术），并推动其未来发展。
