# Sentence Simplification via Large Language Models

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11957v1

原文摘要:
Sentence Simplification aims to rephrase complex sentences into simpler
sentences while retaining original meaning. Large Language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated the ability to perform a variety of natural language processing
tasks. However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can be served as a
high-quality sentence simplification system. In this work, we empirically
analyze the zero-/few-shot learning ability of LLMs by evaluating them on a
number of benchmark test sets. Experimental results show LLMs outperform
state-of-the-art sentence simplification methods, and are judged to be on a par
with human annotators.

句子简化旨在将复杂句子改写成更简单的表达，同时保持原意不变。大型语言模型（LLMs）已展现出处理多种自然语言处理任务的能力，但其能否作为高质量的句子简化系统尚未明确。本研究通过在多组基准测试集上的实验评估，实证分析了LLMs的零样本/小样本学习能力。实验结果表明，LLMs不仅超越了当前最先进的句子简化方法，其生成质量更被判定达到人类标注者的水平。
