原文摘要:
Background: The adoption of chatbots into software development tasks has
become increasingly popular among practitioners, driven by the advantages of
cost reduction and acceleration of the software development process. Chatbots
understand users' queries through the Natural Language Understanding component
(NLU). To yield reasonable performance, NLUs have to be trained with extensive,
high-quality datasets, that express a multitude of ways users may interact with
chatbots. However, previous studies show that creating a high-quality training
dataset for software engineering chatbots is expensive in terms of both
resources and time. Aims: Therefore, in this paper, we present an automated
transformer-based approach to augment software engineering chatbot datasets.
Method: Our approach combines traditional natural language processing
techniques with the BART transformer to augment a dataset by generating queries
through synonym replacement and paraphrasing. We evaluate the impact of using
the augmentation approach on the Rasa NLU's performance using three software
engineering datasets. Results: Overall, the augmentation approach shows
promising results in improving the Rasa's performance, augmenting queries with
varying sentence structures while preserving their original semantics.
Furthermore, it increases Rasa's confidence in its intent classification for
the correctly classified intents. Conclusions: We believe that our study helps
practitioners improve the performance of their chatbots and guides future
research to propose augmentation techniques for SE chatbots.

背景：在降低成本与加速软件开发流程的优势驱动下，聊天机器人应用于软件开发任务的现象在从业者中日益普及。聊天机器人通过自然语言理解组件（NLU）解析用户查询。为获得合理性能，NLU必须通过大量高质量数据集进行训练，这些数据集需涵盖用户与机器人交互的多种表达方式。然而，先前研究表明，为软件工程聊天机器人创建高质量训练数据集在资源和时间成本上均十分昂贵。目的：为此，本文提出一种基于Transformer架构的自动化增强方法，用于扩充软件工程聊天机器人数据集。方法：我们结合传统自然语言处理技术与BART Transformer模型，通过同义词替换与句式重构生成查询语句来实现数据集扩增。基于三个软件工程数据集，我们评估了该增强方法对Rasa NLU性能的影响。结果：总体而言，该增强方法在提升Rasa性能方面展现出积极效果，既能生成句式多样的查询语句又保持原始语义完整性。此外，该方法还提高了Rasa对正确分类意图的置信度。结论：我们相信本研究有助于从业者提升聊天机器人性能，并为未来软件工程聊天机器人数据增强技术的研究提供指引。
