原文摘要:
This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the
art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for
readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over
the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training
models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text
documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information.
Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with
superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed
by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be
applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from
image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a
blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been
called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction to basic NLP models the
main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer
are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive
embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed,
such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input
texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models
for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering,
translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text,
etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models
are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition,
links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter
summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential
developments of AI.

这本开放获取的书籍全面概述了基础模型的研究与应用现状，适合熟悉自然语言处理（NLP）基础概念的读者阅读。近年来，一种革命性的新范式被开发用于训练NLP模型。这些模型首先在大量文本集合上进行预训练，以获取通用的句法知识和语义信息。随后，它们针对特定任务进行微调，通常能以超人的准确度解决问题。当模型规模足够大时，仅需通过提示指令即可解决新任务而无需微调。此外，它们可广泛应用于图像视频处理、机器人控制学习等跨媒体问题领域。由于为人工智能多任务解决提供了通用方案，这类模型被称为基础模型。

本书首先简要介绍NLP基础模型，重点阐述BERT、GPT等预训练语言模型及序列到序列转换器架构，解析自注意力机制与上下文敏感嵌入等核心概念。随后探讨模型优化的多种路径，包括扩展预训练目标、增长输入文本长度、融入外部知识等。书中系统梳理了约二十个应用领域（如问答系统、机器翻译、故事生成、对话系统、文生图等）的高性能模型，客观分析各领域现有模型的优势与局限，并展望未来发展方向。每章均提供可自由获取的程序代码链接。终章总结人工智能带来的经济机遇、风险缓解措施及潜在发展趋势。
