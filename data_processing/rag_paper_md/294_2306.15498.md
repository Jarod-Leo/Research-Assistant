# Using Large Language Models to Provide Explanatory Feedback to Human Tutors

原文摘要:
Research demonstrates learners engaging in the process of producing
explanations to support their reasoning, can have a positive impact on
learning. However, providing learners real-time explanatory feedback often
presents challenges related to classification accuracy, particularly in
domain-specific environments, containing situationally complex and nuanced
responses. We present two approaches for supplying tutors real-time feedback
within an online lesson on how to give students effective praise. This
work-in-progress demonstrates considerable accuracy in binary classification
for corrective feedback of effective, or effort-based (F1 score = 0.811), and
ineffective, or outcome-based (F1 score = 0.350), praise responses. More
notably, we introduce progress towards an enhanced approach of providing
explanatory feedback using large language model-facilitated named entity
recognition, which can provide tutors feedback, not only while engaging in
lessons, but can potentially suggest real-time tutor moves. Future work
involves leveraging large language models for data augmentation to improve
accuracy, while also developing an explanatory feedback interface.

研究表明，学习者在参与构建解释以支持其推理的过程中，能够对学习产生积极影响。然而，为学习者提供实时解释性反馈往往面临分类准确性的挑战，特别是在包含情境复杂且具有细微差别应答的特定领域环境中。我们提出了两种方法，在关于如何给予学生有效表扬的在线课程中为导师提供实时反馈。这项进行中的工作展示了在二元分类中对有效表扬（基于努力，F1分数=0.811）和无效表扬（基于结果，F1分数=0.350）进行纠正反馈的较高准确性。更值得注意的是，我们介绍了一种利用大语言模型辅助命名实体识别的增强方法，该方法不仅能在导师参与课程时提供反馈，还有潜力实时建议导师的互动策略。未来工作包括利用大语言模型进行数据增强以提高准确性，同时开发解释性反馈界面。
