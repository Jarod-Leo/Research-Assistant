原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly emerging in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) applications, especially in the fields of natural language processing and
generative AI. Not limited to text generation applications, these models
inherently possess the opportunity to leverage prompt engineering, where the
inputs of such models can be appropriately structured to articulate a model's
purpose explicitly. A prominent example of this is intent-based networking, an
emerging approach for automating and maintaining network operations and
management. This paper presents semantic routing to achieve enhanced
performance in LLM-assisted intent-based management and orchestration of 5G
core networks. This work establishes an end-to-end intent extraction framework
and presents a diverse dataset of sample user intents accompanied by a thorough
analysis of the effects of encoders and quantization on overall system
performance. The results show that using a semantic router improves the
accuracy and efficiency of the LLM deployment compared to stand-alone LLMs with
prompting architectures.

大型语言模型（LLM）正迅速崛起于人工智能应用领域，尤其在自然语言处理与生成式AI中表现突出。这些模型的应用不仅限于文本生成，其内在优势在于能够通过提示工程巧妙构建输入内容，从而明确表达模型意图。典型案例如基于意图的网络技术——一种新兴的自动化运维管理方法。本文提出语义路由技术，旨在提升LLM辅助的5G核心网意图管理与编排性能。研究构建了端到端意图提取框架，并提供了多样化的用户意图样本数据集，同时深入分析了编码器与量化技术对系统整体性能的影响。实验结果表明：相较于采用提示架构的独立LLM，引入语义路由能显著提高模型部署的准确性和效率。
