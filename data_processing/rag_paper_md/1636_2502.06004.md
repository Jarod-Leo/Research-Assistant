# Analysis of LLM as a grammatical feature tagger for African American English

原文摘要:
African American English (AAE) presents unique challenges in natural language
processing (NLP). This research systematically compares the performance of
available NLP models--rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models
(LLMs)--capable of identifying key grammatical features of AAE, namely Habitual
Be and Multiple Negation. These features were selected for their distinct
grammatical complexity and frequency of occurrence. The evaluation involved
sentence-level binary classification tasks, using both zero-shot and few-shot
strategies. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise compared to the
baseline, they are influenced by biases such as recency and unrelated features
in the text such as formality. This study highlights the necessity for improved
model training and architectural adjustments to better accommodate AAE's unique
linguistic characteristics. Data and code are available.

非洲裔美国人英语（AAE）在自然语言处理（NLP）领域提出了独特的挑战。本研究系统性地比较了现有NLP模型——基于规则的模型、基于Transformer的模型以及大语言模型（LLMs）——在识别AAE关键语法特征（即习惯性"Be"和多重否定）方面的表现。这些特征因其独特的语法复杂性和高频出现而被选为研究对象。评估过程采用零样本和小样本策略，通过句子级二元分类任务进行。分析表明，虽然大语言模型相较于基线模型展现出潜力，但仍受到文本中近期性偏差及无关特征（如正式程度）的影响。该研究强调需要改进模型训练和架构调整，以更好地适应AAE独特的语言特征。相关数据与代码已公开。
