原文摘要:
The automation of resume screening is a crucial aspect of the recruitment
process in organizations. Automated resume screening systems often encompass a
range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This paper introduces a novel
Large Language Models (LLMs) based agent framework for resume screening, aimed
at enhancing efficiency and time management in recruitment processes. Our
framework is distinct in its ability to efficiently summarize and grade each
resume from a large dataset. Moreover, it utilizes LLM agents for
decision-making. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a dataset from
actual resumes and simulated a resume screening process. Subsequently, the
outcomes of the simulation experiment were compared and subjected to detailed
analysis. The results demonstrate that our automated resume screening framework
is 11 times faster than traditional manual methods. Furthermore, by fine-tuning
the LLMs, we observed a significant improvement in the F1 score, reaching
87.73\%, during the resume sentence classification phase. In the resume
summarization and grading phase, our fine-tuned model surpassed the baseline
performance of the GPT-3.5 model. Analysis of the decision-making efficacy of
the LLM agents in the final offer stage further underscores the potential of
LLM agents in transforming resume screening processes.
