原文摘要:
Zero-shot event-relational reasoning is an important task in natural language
processing, and existing methods jointly learn a variety of event-relational
prefixes and inference-form prefixes to achieve such tasks. However, training
prefixes consumes large computational resources and lacks interpretability.
Additionally, learning various relational and inferential knowledge
inefficiently exploits the connections between tasks. Therefore, we first
propose a method for Reasoning-Oriented Locating and Editing (ROLE), which
locates and edits the key modules of the language model for reasoning about
event relations, enhancing interpretability and also resource-efficiently
optimizing the reasoning ability. Subsequently, we propose a method for
Analogy-Based Locating and Editing (ABLE), which efficiently exploits the
similarities and differences between tasks to optimize the zero-shot reasoning
capability. Experimental results show that ROLE improves interpretability and
reasoning performance with reduced computational cost. ABLE achieves SOTA
results in zero-shot reasoning.

零样本事件关系推理是自然语言处理中的一项重要任务，现有方法通过联合学习多种事件关系前缀与推理形式前缀来实现此类任务。然而，前缀训练会消耗大量计算资源且缺乏可解释性。此外，学习各类关系与推理知识时未能高效利用任务间的关联性。为此，我们首先提出面向推理的定位编辑方法（ROLE），通过定位并编辑语言模型中用于事件关系推理的关键模块，在增强可解释性的同时，以资源高效的方式优化推理能力。随后提出基于类比的定位编辑方法（ABLE），通过高效利用任务间的共性与差异来优化零样本推理性能。实验结果表明，ROLE在降低计算成本的同时提升了可解释性与推理性能，ABLE则在零样本推理中取得了最优效果。
