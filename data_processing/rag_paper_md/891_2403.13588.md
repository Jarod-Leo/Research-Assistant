原文摘要:
As Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), a popular approach for code
intelligence, continue to grow in size, the computational cost of their usage
has become prohibitively expensive. Prompt learning, a recent development in
the field of natural language processing, emerges as a potential solution to
address this challenge. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
prompt learning in code intelligence tasks. We unveil its reliance on manually
designed prompts, which often require significant human effort and expertise.
Moreover, we discover existing automatic prompt design methods are very limited
to code intelligence tasks due to factors including gradient dependence, high
computational demands, and limited applicability. To effectively address both
issues, we propose Genetic Auto Prompt (GenAP), which utilizes an elaborate
genetic algorithm to automatically design prompts. With GenAP, non-experts can
effortlessly generate superior prompts compared to meticulously manual-designed
ones. GenAP operates without the need for gradients or additional computational
costs, rendering it gradient-free and cost-effective. Moreover, GenAP supports
both understanding and generation types of code intelligence tasks, exhibiting
great applicability. We conduct GenAP on three popular code intelligence PLMs
with three canonical code intelligence tasks including defect prediction, code
summarization, and code translation. The results suggest that GenAP can
effectively automate the process of designing prompts. Specifically, GenAP
outperforms all other methods across all three tasks (e.g., improving accuracy
by an average of 2.13% for defect prediction). To the best of our knowledge,
GenAP is the first work to automatically design prompts for code intelligence
PLMs.

随着预训练语言模型(PLM)作为代码智能的主流方法规模不断扩大，其计算成本已变得极其高昂。自然语言处理领域新兴的提示学习技术为解决这一挑战提供了潜在方案。本文探究了提示学习在代码智能任务中的有效性，揭示了其依赖人工设计提示的局限性——这不仅需要大量人力投入，还要求专业领域知识。进一步研究发现，现有自动提示设计方法因梯度依赖、高计算开销和适用性局限等因素，难以有效应用于代码智能任务。

为此，我们提出遗传自动提示框架(GenAP)，通过精心设计的遗传算法实现提示的自动化设计。GenAP使非专业人士也能轻松生成优于人工精心设计的提示方案，且无需梯度计算或额外算力开销，具有零梯度和低成本优势。该框架同时支持代码理解与生成两类智能任务，展现出卓越的适用性。我们在三种主流代码智能PLM上针对缺陷预测、代码摘要和代码翻译三项典型任务进行验证，结果表明GenAP能有效实现提示设计自动化：在全部任务中均超越其他方法（如缺陷预测准确率平均提升2.13%）。据我们所知，这是首个面向代码智能PLM的自动提示设计研究。
