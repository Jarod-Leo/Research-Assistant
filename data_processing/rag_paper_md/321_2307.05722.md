原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
tasks, demonstrating their exceptional capabilities in various domains.
However, their potential for behavior graph understanding in job
recommendations remains largely unexplored. This paper focuses on unveiling the
capability of large language models in understanding behavior graphs and
leveraging this understanding to enhance recommendations in online recruitment,
including the promotion of out-of-distribution (OOD) application. We present a
novel framework that harnesses the rich contextual information and semantic
representations provided by large language models to analyze behavior graphs
and uncover underlying patterns and relationships. Specifically, we propose a
meta-path prompt constructor that leverages LLM recommender to understand
behavior graphs for the first time and design a corresponding path augmentation
module to alleviate the prompt bias introduced by path-based sequence input. By
leveraging this capability, our framework enables personalized and accurate job
recommendations for individual users. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach on a comprehensive dataset and demonstrate its ability to improve the
relevance and quality of recommended quality. This research not only sheds
light on the untapped potential of large language models but also provides
valuable insights for developing advanced recommendation systems in the
recruitment market. The findings contribute to the growing field of natural
language processing and offer practical implications for enhancing job search
experiences. We release the code at https://github.com/WLiK/GLRec.

大语言模型（LLMs）通过在多领域展现卓越能力，彻底革新了自然语言处理任务。然而，其在职位推荐场景中行为图理解方面的潜力仍待深入探索。本文重点揭示大语言模型理解行为图谱的能力，并利用这种理解增强在线招聘推荐效果（包括促进分布外申请场景）。我们提出一个创新框架，利用大语言模型提供的丰富上下文信息和语义表征来分析行为图，揭示潜在模式与关联关系。具体而言，我们首次提出基于元路径提示构造器的LLM推荐器来理解行为图，并设计相应的路径增强模块以缓解基于路径的序列输入导致的提示偏差。通过这种能力，我们的框架能为个体用户提供个性化精准职位推荐。我们在综合数据集上验证了方法的有效性，证明其能显著提升推荐内容的相关性与质量。本研究不仅揭示了大语言模型的未开发潜力，更为招聘市场开发先进推荐系统提供了宝贵洞见。这些发现推动了自然语言处理领域发展，并为优化求职体验提供了实践指导。代码已发布于https://github.com/WLiK/GLRec。
