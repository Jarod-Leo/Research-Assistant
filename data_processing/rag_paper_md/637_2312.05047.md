# Converting Epics/Stories into Pseudocode using Transformers

原文摘要:
The conversion of user epics or stories into their appropriate representation
in pseudocode or code is a time-consuming task, which can take up a large
portion of the time in an industrial project. With this research paper, we aim
to present a methodology to generate pseudocode from a given agile user story
of small functionalities so as to reduce the overall time spent on the
industrial project. Pseudocode is a programming language agnostic
representation of the steps involved in a computer program, which can be easily
converted into any programming language. Leveraging the potential of Natural
Language Processing, we want to simplify the development process in
organizations that use the Agile Model of Software Development. We present a
methodology to convert a problem described in the English language into
pseudocode. This methodology divides the Text to Pseudocode conversion task
into two stages or subtasks, each of which is treated like an individual
machine translation task. Stage 1 is Text to Code Conversion and Stage 2 is
Code to Pseudocode Conversion. We find that the CodeT5 model gives the best
results in terms of BLEU score when trained separately on the two subtasks
mentioned above. BLEU score is a metric that is used to measure the similarity
between a machine-translated text and a set of reference translations.

将用户史诗或故事转换为伪代码或代码的适当表达是一项耗时任务，在工业项目中可能占据大量时间。本研究旨在提出一种方法，通过从给定的小功能敏捷用户故事生成伪代码，以减少工业项目的整体耗时。伪代码是一种与编程语言无关的计算机程序步骤表示形式，可轻松转换为任何编程语言。借助自然语言处理的潜力，我们希望简化采用敏捷软件开发模式的组织的开发流程。本文提出了一种将英语描述的问题转换为伪代码的方法论，该过程被划分为两个阶段或子任务：第一阶段为文本到代码转换，第二阶段为代码到伪代码转换，每个子任务均被视为独立的机器翻译任务。实验表明，当CodeT5模型在上述两个子任务上分别训练时，其BLEU得分表现最佳。BLEU得分是一种用于衡量机器翻译文本与参考译文集之间相似度的指标。
