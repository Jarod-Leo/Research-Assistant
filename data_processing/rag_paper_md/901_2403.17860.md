原文摘要:
Language models (LMs) have achieved impressive accuracy across a variety of
tasks but remain vulnerable to high-confidence misclassifications, also
referred to as unknown unknowns (UUs). These UUs cluster into blind spots in
the feature space, leading to significant risks in high-stakes applications.
This is particularly relevant for smaller, lightweight LMs that are more
susceptible to such errors. While the identification of UUs has been
extensively studied, their mitigation remains an open challenge, including how
to use identified UUs to eliminate unseen blind spots. In this work, we propose
a novel approach to address blind spot mitigation through the use of
intelligent agents -- either humans or large LMs -- as teachers to characterize
UU-type errors. By leveraging the generalization capabilities of intelligent
agents, we identify patterns in high-confidence misclassifications and use them
to generate targeted synthetic samples to improve model robustness and reduce
blind spots. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our method on three
classification tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the number
of UUs, all while maintaining a similar level of accuracy. We find that the
effectiveness of human computation has a high ceiling but is highly dependent
on familiarity with the underlying task. Moreover, the cost gap between humans
and LMs surpasses an order of magnitude, as LMs attain human-like
generalization and generation performance while being more scalable.

语言模型（LMs）在多项任务中展现出卓越的准确性，但仍存在高置信度误分类的脆弱性，这类错误被称为未知未知（UUs）。这些UUs会聚集在特征空间的盲区，给高风险应用带来重大隐患，尤其对更易受此类错误影响的小型轻量级LMs而言更为突出。尽管UUs的识别已得到广泛研究，但其缓解仍是一个开放挑战，包括如何利用已识别的UUs消除未见的盲区。本研究提出一种创新方法，通过智能代理（人类或大型LMs）作为教师来表征UU型错误，从而解决盲区缓解问题。借助智能代理的泛化能力，我们识别高置信度误分类的模式，并据此生成针对性合成样本以提升模型鲁棒性、减少盲区。我们在三项分类任务上对该方法进行了全面评估，证明其能有效减少UUs数量，同时保持相近的准确率水平。研究发现人类计算的效能上限较高，但高度依赖对底层任务的熟悉程度；而LMs与人类之间的成本差距超过一个数量级——LMs在实现类人泛化与生成性能的同时具备更强的可扩展性。
