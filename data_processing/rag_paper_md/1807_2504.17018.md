原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to a wide range of
tools, tasks, and problem-solving processes, especially in software
development. Originally designed for natural language processing tasks such as
text generation, LLMs are increasingly being used to assist both professionals
and students in writing code. This growing reliance on LLM-based tools is
reshaping programming workflows and task execution. In this study, we explore
the impact of these technologies on blind and low-vision (BLV) developers. Our
review of existing literature indicates that while LLMs help mitigate some of
the challenges faced by BLV programmers, they also introduce new forms of
inaccessibility. We conducted an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered
integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance across
a comprehensive set of programming tasks. Our findings highlight several
unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and notable
limitations in interaction support for specific tasks. Through observing BLV
developers as they engaged in coding activities, we uncovered key interaction
barriers that go beyond model accuracy or code generation quality. This paper
outlines the challenges and corresponding opportunities for improving
accessibility in the context of generative AI-assisted programming. Addressing
these issues can meaningfully enhance the programming experience for BLV
developers. As the generative AI revolution continues to unfold, it must also
address the unique burdens faced by this community.

大型语言模型（LLMs）正迅速成为各类工具、任务和问题解决流程中不可或缺的组成部分，尤其在软件开发领域。这类最初为文本生成等自然语言处理任务设计的模型，正日益被用于协助专业人士和学生编写代码。基于LLM的工具日益普及，正在重塑编程工作流和任务执行方式。本研究探讨了这些技术对盲人及低视力（BLV）开发者的影响。通过文献综述发现，虽然LLMs有助于缓解BLV程序员面临的某些挑战，但也带来了新的可访问性障碍。我们对五款主流LLM驱动的集成开发环境（IDE）进行了评估，测试其在完整编程任务集中的表现。研究结果揭示了若干未支持场景、模型输出错误案例，以及特定任务交互支持的显著局限。通过观察BLV开发者进行编码活动，我们发现了超越模型准确性或代码生成质量的关键交互障碍。本文系统阐述了生成式AI辅助编程背景下存在的可访问性挑战及改进机遇。解决这些问题将切实提升BLV开发者的编程体验。随着生成式AI革命的持续推进，必须同步解决该群体面临的独特负担。
