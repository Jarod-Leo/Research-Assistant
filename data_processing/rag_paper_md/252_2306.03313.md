# A Scalable and Adaptive System to Infer the Industry Sectors of Companies: Prompt + Model Tuning of Generative Language Models

原文摘要:
The Private Equity (PE) firms operate investment funds by acquiring and
managing companies to achieve a high return upon selling. Many PE funds are
thematic, meaning investment professionals aim to identify trends by covering
as many industry sectors as possible, and picking promising companies within
these sectors. So, inferring sectors for companies is critical to the success
of thematic PE funds. In this work, we standardize the sector framework and
discuss the typical challenges; we then introduce our sector inference system
addressing these challenges. Specifically, our system is built on a
medium-sized generative language model, finetuned with a prompt + model tuning
procedure. The deployed model demonstrates a superior performance than the
common baselines. The system has been serving many PE professionals for over a
year, showing great scalability to data volume and adaptability to any change
in sector framework and/or annotation.

私募股权（PE）公司通过收购并管理企业来运营投资基金，最终以出售实现高额回报。许多PE基金采用主题投资策略，即投资专业人员力求覆盖尽可能多的行业领域以识别趋势，并筛选出这些领域内具有潜力的企业。因此，准确推断企业所属行业对主题型PE基金的成功至关重要。本研究首先规范了行业分类框架并探讨了典型挑战，随后介绍了针对这些挑战设计的行业推断系统。该系统基于中等规模生成式语言模型构建，通过提示优化与模型微调相结合的方法进行训练。实际部署的模型性能显著优于常见基线方案。该系统已为众多PE从业者服务超过一年，展现出优异的数据规模扩展能力，并能灵活适应行业框架或标注标准的任何变更。
