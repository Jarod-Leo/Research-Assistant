原文摘要:
In the universe of Natural Language Processing, Transformer-based language
models like BERT and (Chat)GPT have emerged as lexical superheroes with great
power to solve open research problems. In this paper, we specifically focus on
the temporal problem of semantic change, and evaluate their ability to solve
two diachronic extensions of the Word-in-Context (WiC) task: TempoWiC and
HistoWiC. In particular, we investigate the potential of a novel, off-the-shelf
technology like ChatGPT (and GPT) 3.5 compared to BERT, which represents a
family of models that currently stand as the state-of-the-art for modeling
semantic change. Our experiments represent the first attempt to assess the use
of (Chat)GPT for studying semantic change. Our results indicate that ChatGPT
performs significantly worse than the foundational GPT version. Furthermore,
our results demonstrate that (Chat)GPT achieves slightly lower performance than
BERT in detecting long-term changes but performs significantly worse in
detecting short-term changes.

在自然语言处理的广阔领域中，基于Transformer架构的语言模型（如BERT和(Chat)GPT）已成为解决开放性研究问题的"词汇超级英雄"，展现出强大的能力。本文聚焦语义变迁这一时序性问题，评估了此类模型在完成"上下文词汇"（WiC）任务两项历时性扩展任务——TempoWiC与HistoWiC时的表现。我们重点对比了ChatGPT（及GPT-3.5）这类新型即用技术与当前语义演变建模领域最先进的BERT模型家族。本研究首次尝试评估(Chat)GPT在语义演变研究中的应用价值。实验结果表明：ChatGPT的性能显著低于基础版GPT模型；在长期语义变化检测任务中，(Chat)GPT略逊于BERT模型，而在短期变化检测任务中则表现明显欠佳。
