原文摘要:
App reviews from app stores are crucial for improving software requirements.
A large number of valuable reviews are continually being posted, describing
software problems and expected features. Effectively utilizing user reviews
necessitates the extraction of relevant information, as well as their
subsequent summarization. Due to the substantial volume of user reviews, manual
analysis is arduous. Various approaches based on natural language processing
(NLP) have been proposed for automatic user review mining. However, the
majority of them requires a manually crafted dataset to train their models,
which limits their usage in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose
Mini-BAR, a tool that integrates large language models (LLMs) to perform
zero-shot mining of user reviews in both English and French. Specifically,
Mini-BAR is designed to (i) classify the user reviews, (ii) cluster similar
reviews together, (iii) generate an abstractive summary for each cluster and
(iv) rank the user review clusters. To evaluate the performance of Mini-BAR, we
created a dataset containing 6,000 English and 6,000 French annotated user
reviews and conducted extensive experiments. Preliminary results demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of Mini-BAR in requirement engineering by
analyzing bilingual app reviews. (Replication package containing the code,

应用商店中的用户评论对优化软件需求至关重要。海量有价值的评论持续涌现，这些内容既描述了软件问题也反映了用户期待的功能特性。要有效利用用户反馈，不仅需要提取关键信息，还需对其进行系统性归纳。鉴于用户评论数量庞大，人工分析难度极高。目前已有多种基于自然语言处理（NLP）的自动化评论挖掘方法被提出，但大多数需要人工标注数据集来训练模型，这限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

本研究提出的Mini-BAR工具创新性地整合大语言模型（LLMs），实现了对英法双语用户评论的零样本挖掘。该工具具备四大核心功能：（1）用户评论分类；（2）相似评论聚类；（3）为每个聚类生成抽象摘要；（4）评论聚类优先级排序。为评估工具性能，我们构建了包含6,000条英文和6,000条法文标注评论的数据集，并进行了全面实验。初步结果表明，Mini-BAR通过分析双语应用评论，在需求工程领域展现出卓越的效能与效率。（完整复现包含代码、数据集及实验配置详见https://github.com/Jl-wei/mini-bar）
