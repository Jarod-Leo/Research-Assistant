原文摘要:
Querying structured databases with natural language (NL2SQL) has remained a
difficult problem for years. Recently, the advancement of machine learning
(ML), natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLM) have
led to significant improvements in performance, with the best model achieving
~85% percent accuracy on the benchmark Spider dataset. However, there is a lack
of a systematic understanding of the types, causes, and effectiveness of
error-handling mechanisms of errors for erroneous queries nowadays. To bridge
the gap, a taxonomy of errors made by four representative NL2SQL models was
built in this work, along with an in-depth analysis of the errors. Second, the
causes of model errors were explored by analyzing the model-human attention
alignment to the natural language query. Last, a within-subjects user study
with 26 participants was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of three
interactive error-handling mechanisms in NL2SQL. Findings from this paper shed
light on the design of model structure and error discovery and repair
strategies for natural language data query interfaces in the future.

多年来，利用自然语言查询结构化数据库（NL2SQL）始终是一项具有挑战性的任务。随着机器学习（ML）、自然语言处理（NLP）以及大语言模型（LLM）技术的进步，该领域性能已取得显著提升——当前最佳模型在Spider基准数据集上的准确率已达约85%。然而，目前对于错误查询的类别划分、成因分析以及纠错机制的有效性仍缺乏系统性研究。为填补这一空白，本研究首先构建了四种代表性NL2SQL模型错误类型的分类体系，并对其进行了深入解析；其次通过分析模型与人类对自然语言查询的注意力分布差异，探究了错误产生的内在原因；最后通过26名参与者参与的组内用户实验，评估了三种交互式纠错机制在NL2SQL中的实际效果。本文的研究成果为未来自然语言数据查询接口的模型结构设计及错误发现与修复策略提供了重要启示。
