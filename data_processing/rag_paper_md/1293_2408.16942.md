原文摘要:
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia, particularly Sinophobia,
leading to widespread discrimination against individuals of Chinese descent.
Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained deep learning models used for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The ability of LLMs to understand and
generate human-like text makes them particularly useful for analysing social
media data to detect and evaluate sentiments. We present a sentiment analysis
framework utilising LLMs for longitudinal sentiment analysis of the Sinophobic
sentiments expressed in X (Twitter) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results
show a significant correlation between the spikes in Sinophobic tweets,
Sinophobic sentiments and surges in COVID-19 cases, revealing that the
evolution of the pandemic influenced public sentiment and the prevalence of
Sinophobic discourse. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis revealed a
predominant presence of negative sentiments, such as annoyance and denial,
which underscores the impact of political narratives and misinformation shaping
public opinion. The lack of empathetic sentiment which was present in previous
studies related to COVID-19 highlights the way the political narratives in
media viewed the pandemic and how it blamed the Chinese community. Our study
highlights the importance of transparent communication in mitigating xenophobic
sentiments during global crises.

新冠疫情加剧了仇外心理，尤其是针对中国的歧视，导致华裔群体遭受广泛歧视。大语言模型（LLM）作为预训练的深度学习模型，被广泛应用于自然语言处理任务。其理解和生成类人文本的能力，使其特别适用于分析社交媒体数据以检测和评估公众情绪。本研究构建了一个基于LLM的情感分析框架，对疫情期间推特平台反华情绪的演变进行纵向分析。结果显示，反华推文数量激增、反华情绪高涨与新冠病例数飙升之间存在显著相关性，表明疫情发展深刻影响了公众情绪和反华言论的传播。情感分析进一步发现，恼怒、否认等负面情绪占据主导地位，这凸显出政治叙事和虚假信息对舆论的塑造作用。与早期新冠相关研究相比，本研究发现同理心情感显著缺失，反映出媒体政治叙事将疫情污名化、归咎于华人社群的特点。本研究揭示了全球危机中透明沟通对缓解仇外情绪的重要性。
