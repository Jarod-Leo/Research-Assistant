原文摘要:
Prompt engineering is a technique that involves augmenting a large
pre-trained model with task-specific hints, known as prompts, to adapt the
model to new tasks. Prompts can be created manually as natural language
instructions or generated automatically as either natural language instructions
or vector representations. Prompt engineering enables the ability to perform
predictions based solely on prompts without updating model parameters, and the
easier application of large pre-trained models in real-world tasks. In past
years, Prompt engineering has been well-studied in natural language processing.
Recently, it has also been intensively studied in vision-language modeling.
However, there is currently a lack of a systematic overview of prompt
engineering on pre-trained vision-language models. This paper aims to provide a
comprehensive survey of cutting-edge research in prompt engineering on three
types of vision-language models: multimodal-to-text generation models (e.g.
Flamingo), image-text matching models (e.g. CLIP), and text-to-image generation
models (e.g. Stable Diffusion). For each type of model, a brief model summary,
prompting methods, prompting-based applications, and the corresponding
responsibility and integrity issues are summarized and discussed. Furthermore,
the commonalities and differences between prompting on vision-language models,
language models, and vision models are also discussed. The challenges, future
directions, and research opportunities are summarized to foster future research
on this topic.

提示工程是一种通过任务特定提示（即prompt）增强大型预训练模型的技术，使其能够适应新任务。提示可以手动创建为自然语言指令，或自动生成自然语言指令或向量表示。该技术实现了仅依赖提示进行预测而无需更新模型参数的能力，并降低了预训练大模型在实际任务中的应用门槛。过去几年，提示工程在自然语言处理领域已得到深入研究；近年来，在视觉-语言建模领域也引发了广泛关注。然而，目前尚缺乏对预训练视觉-语言模型中提示工程技术的系统性综述。本文旨在全面梳理三类视觉-语言模型（多模态到文本生成模型如Flamingo、图文匹配模型如CLIP、文本到图像生成模型如Stable Diffusion）中提示工程的前沿研究，针对每类模型分别总结模型概要、提示方法、基于提示的应用场景以及相关的责任与伦理问题。此外，还探讨了视觉-语言模型、纯语言模型与纯视觉模型在提示技术上的共性与差异，最后归纳了该领域面临的挑战、未来方向与研究机遇，以推动该主题的后续发展。
