原文摘要:
In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has played a significant
role in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as chatbots,
text generation, and language translation. The emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has greatly improved the performance of these applications,
showing astonishing results in language understanding and generation. However,
they still show some disadvantages, such as hallucinations and lack of
domain-specific knowledge, that affect their performance in real-world tasks.
These issues can be effectively mitigated by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs), which organise information in structured formats that capture
relationships between entities in a versatile and interpretable fashion.
Likewise, the construction and validation of KGs present challenges that LLMs
can help resolve. The complementary relationship between LLMs and KGs has led
to a trend that combines these technologies to achieve trustworthy results.
This work collected 28 papers outlining methods for KG-powered LLMs, LLM-based
KGs, and LLM-KG hybrid approaches. We systematically analysed and compared
these approaches to provide a comprehensive overview highlighting key trends,
innovative techniques, and common challenges. This synthesis will benefit
researchers new to the field and those seeking to deepen their understanding of
how KGs and LLMs can be effectively combined to enhance AI applications
capabilities.

近年来，自然语言处理（NLP）在聊天机器人、文本生成和语言翻译等多种人工智能（AI）应用中发挥了重要作用。大型语言模型（LLM）的出现极大地提升了这些应用的性能，在语言理解和生成方面展现出惊人效果。然而，它们仍存在幻觉现象和领域知识匮乏等缺陷，影响了实际任务中的表现。通过引入以结构化形式组织信息、能灵活可解释地捕捉实体间关系的知识图谱（KG），可有效缓解这些问题。同样，知识图谱的构建与验证也面临着LLM技术可协助解决的挑战。LLM与KG之间的互补性促使二者结合成为实现可信结果的技术趋势。

本研究收集了28篇相关论文，系统梳理了知识图谱增强型LLM、基于LLM的知识图谱构建以及LLM-KG混合方法三大类技术路径。通过系统分析与横向对比，我们全面总结了该领域的核心趋势、创新技术和共性挑战。这一综述既有助于初涉该领域的研究者快速把握方向，也能为深入探索如何有效融合知识图谱与语言模型以增强AI应用能力提供参考框架。
