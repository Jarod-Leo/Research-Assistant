原文摘要:
Text simplification is one of the domains in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) that offers an opportunity to understand the text in a simplified manner
for exploration. However, it is always hard to understand and retrieve
knowledge from unstructured text, which is usually in the form of compound and
complex sentences. There are state-of-the-art neural network-based methods to
simplify the sentences for improved readability while replacing words with
plain English substitutes and summarising the sentences and paragraphs. In the
Knowledge Graph (KG) creation process from unstructured text, summarising long
sentences and substituting words is undesirable since this may lead to
information loss. However, KG creation from text requires the extraction of all
possible facts (triples) with the same mentions as in the text. In this work,
we propose a controlled simplification based on the factual information in a
sentence, i.e., triple. We present a classical syntactic dependency-based
approach to split and rephrase a compound and complex sentence into a set of
simplified sentences. This simplification process will retain the original
wording with a simple structure of possible domain facts in each sentence,
i.e., triples. The paper also introduces an algorithm to identify and measure a
sentence's syntactic complexity (SC), followed by reduction through a
controlled syntactic simplification process. Last, an experiment for a dataset
re-annotation is also conducted through GPT3; we aim to publish this refined
corpus as a resource. This work is accepted and presented in International
workshop on Learning with Knowledge Graphs (IWLKG) at WSDM-2023 Conference. The

文本简化是自然语言处理（NLP）中的一个重要领域，旨在以更简明的方式呈现文本内容以便于理解。然而，从非结构化文本（通常由复合句和复杂句构成）中准确提取知识始终具有挑战性。当前最先进的神经网络方法通过替换通俗词汇、概括句子和段落来提升文本可读性，但在基于非结构化文本构建知识图谱（KG）时，过度概括和词汇替换可能导致信息丢失。由于知识图谱构建需要完整保留原文提及的所有可能事实（三元组），本研究提出了一种基于句子事实信息（即三元组）的受控简化方法。

我们采用基于句法依存关系的经典方法，将复合句和复杂句分解重组为一组结构简化的句子。该简化过程在保持原始措辞的同时，确保每个句子呈现简单的领域事实结构（即三元组）。本文还提出了一种算法用于识别和量化句子的句法复杂度（SC），继而通过受控句法简化流程实现复杂度降低。最后，我们利用GPT-3进行了数据集重标注实验，计划将优化后的语料库作为资源公开发布。本研究成果已被WSDM-2023会议"知识图谱学习国际研讨会（IWLKG）"接收并展示，相关代码和数据详见www.github.com/sallmanm/SynSim。
