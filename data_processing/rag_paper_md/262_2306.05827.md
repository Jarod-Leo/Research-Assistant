原文摘要:
With the ever-increasing utilization of natural language processing (NLP), we
started to witness over the past few years a significant transformation in our
interaction with legal texts. This technology has advanced the analysis and
enhanced the understanding of complex legal terminology and contexts. The
development of recent large language models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT, has
also introduced a revolutionary contribution to the way that legal texts can be
processed and comprehended. In this paper, we present our work on a
cooperative-legal question-answering LLM-based chatbot, where we developed a
set of legal questions about Palestinian cooperatives, associated with their
regulations and compared the auto-generated answers by the chatbot to their
correspondences that are designed by a legal expert. To evaluate the proposed
chatbot, we have used 50 queries generated by the legal expert and compared the
answers produced by the chart to their relevance judgments. Finding
demonstrated that an overall accuracy rate of 82% has been achieved when
answering the queries, while exhibiting an F1 score equivalent to 79%.

随着自然语言处理（NLP）技术的广泛应用，过去几年我们见证了与法律文本交互方式的重大变革。该技术不仅推动了复杂法律术语和语境的分析，更深化了对其理解。近期大型语言模型（LLMs）尤其是ChatGPT的发展，为法律文本处理与解读带来了革命性突破。本文聚焦于基于LLM的合作制法律问答聊天机器人研究：我们构建了关于巴勒斯坦合作社法规的相关法律问题集，将聊天机器人自动生成的答案与法律专家设计的标准回答进行对比验证。通过采用法律专家生成的50组查询进行系统评估，并将模型输出答案与人工判定结果进行相关性比对。实验表明，该系统在回答查询时整体准确率达到82%，F1分数达79%。
