原文摘要:
The swift spread of fake news and disinformation campaigns poses a
significant threat to public trust, political stability, and cybersecurity.
Traditional Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) approaches, which rely on low-level
indicators such as domain names and social media handles, are easily evaded by
adversaries who frequently modify their online infrastructure. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel CTI framework that focuses on high-level,
semantic indicators derived from recurrent narratives and relationships of
disinformation campaigns. Our approach extracts structured CTI indicators from
unstructured disinformation content, capturing key entities and their
contextual dependencies within fake news using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
further introduce FakeCTI, the first dataset that systematically links fake
news to disinformation campaigns and threat actors. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our CTI framework, we analyze multiple fake news attribution
techniques, spanning from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
fine-tuned LLMs. This work shifts the focus from low-level artifacts to
persistent conceptual structures, establishing a scalable and adaptive approach
to tracking and countering disinformation campaigns.

虚假新闻与不实信息的迅速蔓延对公众信任、政治稳定及网络安全构成严峻威胁。传统网络威胁情报（CTI）方法依赖域名和社交媒体账号等底层指标，极易被频繁变更网络基础设施的对手规避。为突破这些局限，我们提出一种新型CTI框架，聚焦于从不实信息活动中提取的高层次语义指标——包括反复出现的叙事模式和关联关系。该框架利用大语言模型（LLMs）从非结构化不实信息内容中提取结构化CTI指标，捕捉虚假新闻中的关键实体及其语境依赖关系。我们进一步推出首个系统关联假新闻与不实信息活动、威胁主体的数据集FakeCTI。为评估框架效能，我们分析了从传统自然语言处理（NLP）到微调大语言模型等多种假新闻溯源技术。本研究将焦点从底层技术特征转向持久性概念结构，建立起可扩展、自适应的不实信息活动追踪与应对体系。
