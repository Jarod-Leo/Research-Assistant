原文摘要:
Automated brain tumor segmentation based on deep learning (DL) has achieved
promising performance. However, it generally relies on annotated images for
model training, which is not always feasible in clinical settings. Therefore,
the development of unsupervised DL-based brain tumor segmentation approaches
without expert annotations is desired. Motivated by the success of prompt
learning (PL) in natural language processing, we propose an approach to
unsupervised brain tumor segmentation by designing image-based prompts that
allow indication of brain tumors, and this approach is dubbed as PL-based Brain
Tumor Segmentation (PL-BTS). Specifically, instead of directly training a model
for brain tumor segmentation with a large amount of annotated data, we seek to
train a model that can answer the question: is a voxel in the input image
associated with tumor-like hyper-/hypo-intensity? Such a model can be trained
by artificially generating tumor-like hyper-/hypo-intensity on images without
tumors with hand-crafted designs. Since the hand-crafted designs may be too
simplistic to represent all kinds of real tumors, the trained model may overfit
the simplistic hand-crafted task rather than actually answer the question of
abnormality. To address this problem, we propose the use of a validation task,
where we generate a different hand-crafted task to monitor overfitting. In
addition, we propose PL-BTS+ that further improves PL-BTS by exploiting
unannotated images with brain tumors. Compared with competing unsupervised
methods, the proposed method has achieved marked improvements on both public
and in-house datasets, and we have also demonstrated its possible extension to
other brain lesion segmentation tasks.

基于深度学习（DL）的自动化脑肿瘤分割已展现出优异性能，但其通常依赖标注图像进行模型训练，而这在临床环境中往往难以实现。因此，开发无需专家标注的无监督DL脑肿瘤分割方法成为迫切需求。受提示学习（PL）在自然语言处理领域成功的启发，我们提出一种通过设计基于图像的提示来指示脑肿瘤的无监督分割方法，称为基于提示学习的脑肿瘤分割（PL-BTS）。具体而言，我们不直接使用大量标注数据训练分割模型，而是训练一个能回答以下问题的模型：输入图像中的体素是否呈现类似肿瘤的高/低信号强度？该模型可通过在无肿瘤图像上人工生成设计好的类肿瘤高/低信号强度进行训练。

由于人工设计可能过于简化而无法涵盖真实肿瘤的多样性，训练模型可能过度拟合简单任务而非真正识别异常。针对此问题，我们提出引入验证任务机制，通过生成另一套人工设计任务来监控过拟合现象。此外，我们还提出PL-BTS+方法，通过利用未标注的脑肿瘤图像进一步提升PL-BTS性能。

相较于现有无监督方法，本方法在公开数据集和内部数据集上均取得显著提升。实验还验证了该方法可扩展至其他脑部病变分割任务的潜力。
