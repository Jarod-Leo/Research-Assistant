原文摘要:
Typical text recognition methods rely on an encoder-decoder structure, in
which the encoder extracts features from an image, and the decoder produces
recognized text from these features. In this study, we propose a simpler and
more effective method for text recognition, known as the Decoder-only
Transformer for Optical Character Recognition (DTrOCR). This method uses a
decoder-only Transformer to take advantage of a generative language model that
is pre-trained on a large corpus. We examined whether a generative language
model that has been successful in natural language processing can also be
effective for text recognition in computer vision. Our experiments demonstrated
that DTrOCR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in
the recognition of printed, handwritten, and scene text in both English and
Chinese.

典型的文本识别方法依赖于编码器-解码器结构，其中编码器从图像中提取特征，解码器则基于这些特征生成识别文本。本研究提出了一种更简单高效的文本识别方法——仅解码器Transformer光学字符识别模型（DTrOCR）。该方法采用纯解码器架构的Transformer，充分利用在大规模语料库上预训练的生成式语言模型。我们验证了在自然语言处理领域表现优异的生成式语言模型能否有效迁移至计算机视觉的文本识别任务。实验结果表明，DTrOCR在英文和中文的印刷体、手写体及场景文本识别任务中，均显著超越了当前最先进方法的性能表现。
