链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20227v1

原文摘要:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed a transformative leap with
the advent of transformer-based architectures, which have significantly
enhanced the ability of machines to understand and generate human-like text.
This paper explores the advancements in transformer models, such as BERT and
GPT, focusing on their superior performance in text understanding tasks
compared to traditional methods like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By
analyzing statistical properties through visual representations-including
probability density functions of text length distributions and feature space
classifications-the study highlights the models' proficiency in handling
long-range dependencies, adapting to conditional shifts, and extracting
features for classification, even with overlapping classes. Drawing on recent
2024 research, including enhancements in multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning
and context-aware chat interactions, the paper outlines a methodology involving
data preparation, model selection, pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like GLUE
and SQuAD, with F1 scores exceeding 90%, though challenges such as high
computational costs persist. This work underscores the pivotal role of
transformers in modern NLP and suggests future directions, including efficiency
optimization and multimodal integration, to further advance language-based AI
systems.
