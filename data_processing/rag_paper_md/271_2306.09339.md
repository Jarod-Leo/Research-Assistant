# From BERT to GPT-3 Codex: Harnessing the Potential of Very Large Language Models for Data Management

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09339v1

原文摘要:
Large language models have recently advanced the state of the art on many
natural language processing benchmarks. The newest generation of models can be
applied to a variety of tasks with little to no specialized training. This
technology creates various opportunities for applications in the context of
data management.
  The tutorial will introduce participants to basic background on language
models, discuss different methods to use language models, and give an overview
and short demonstration of available libraries and APIs. Models for generating
natural language will be considered as well as models, such as GPT-3 Codex,
which complete program code or generate code from natural language
instructions. Finally, the tutorial will discuss recent research in the
database community that exploits language models in the context of traditional
database systems or proposes novel system architectures that are based on them.
  The tutorial is targeted at database researchers. No prior background on
language models is required. The goal of the tutorial is to introduce database
researchers to the latest generation of language models, and to their use cases
in the domain of data management.
