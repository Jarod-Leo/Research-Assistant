原文摘要:
Metaphor detection, a critical task in natural language processing, involves
identifying whether a particular word in a sentence is used metaphorically.
Traditional approaches often rely on supervised learning models that implicitly
encode semantic relationships based on metaphor theories. However, these
methods often suffer from a lack of transparency in their decision-making
processes, which undermines the reliability of their predictions. Recent
research indicates that LLMs (large language models) exhibit significant
potential in metaphor detection. Nevertheless, their reasoning capabilities are
constrained by predefined knowledge graphs. To overcome these limitations, we
propose DMD, a novel dual-perspective framework that harnesses both implicit
and explicit applications of metaphor theories to guide LLMs in metaphor
detection and adopts a self-judgment mechanism to validate the responses from
the aforementioned forms of guidance. In comparison to previous methods, our
framework offers more transparent reasoning processes and delivers more
reliable predictions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of DMD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across widely-used datasets.

隐喻识别作为自然语言处理中的关键任务，旨在判断句子中特定词汇是否以隐喻方式使用。传统方法多依赖监督学习模型，基于隐喻理论隐式编码语义关系，但其决策过程缺乏透明度，影响了预测结果的可靠性。近期研究表明，大语言模型在隐喻识别方面展现出显著潜力，但其推理能力受限于预定义知识图谱。为突破这些局限，我们提出DMD框架——一种融合隐喻理论隐式与显式应用的双重视角方法：既通过理论指导大语言模型进行隐喻识别，又采用自判断机制验证不同指导形式生成的响应。相较于现有方法，该框架具备更透明的推理过程和更可靠的预测性能。实验证明DMD的有效性，在多个主流数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。
