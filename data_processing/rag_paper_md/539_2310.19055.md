原文摘要:
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Classification (RC) are important
steps in extracting information from unstructured text and formatting it into a
machine-readable format. We present a survey of recent deep learning models
that address named entity recognition and relation classification, with focus
on few-shot learning performance. Our survey is helpful for researchers in
knowing the recent techniques in text mining and extracting structured
information from raw text.
