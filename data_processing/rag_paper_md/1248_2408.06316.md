# Body Transformer: Leveraging Robot Embodiment for Policy Learning

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06316v1

原文摘要:
In recent years, the transformer architecture has become the de facto
standard for machine learning algorithms applied to natural language processing
and computer vision. Despite notable evidence of successful deployment of this
architecture in the context of robot learning, we claim that vanilla
transformers do not fully exploit the structure of the robot learning problem.
Therefore, we propose Body Transformer (BoT), an architecture that leverages
the robot embodiment by providing an inductive bias that guides the learning
process. We represent the robot body as a graph of sensors and actuators, and
rely on masked attention to pool information throughout the architecture. The
resulting architecture outperforms the vanilla transformer, as well as the
classical multilayer perceptron, in terms of task completion, scaling
properties, and computational efficiency when representing either imitation or
reinforcement learning policies. Additional material including the open-source
code is available at https://sferrazza.cc/bot_site.

近年来，Transformer架构已成为应用于自然语言处理与计算机视觉领域的机器学习算法事实标准。尽管已有显著证据表明该架构在机器人学习中的成功应用，但我们认为标准Transformer并未充分挖掘机器人学习问题的内在结构。为此，我们提出身体感知Transformer（BoT）架构，通过引入引导学习过程的归纳偏置来有效利用机器人具身特性。该架构将机器人身体建模为传感器与执行器构成的图结构，并采用掩码注意力机制实现全架构信息聚合。实验表明，在表征模仿学习或强化学习策略时，该架构在任务完成度、扩展性能和计算效率方面均优于标准Transformer及经典多层感知机。开源代码等补充材料详见https://sferrazza.cc/bot_site。
