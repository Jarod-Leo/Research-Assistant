# Tele-LLMs: A Series of Specialized Large Language Models for Telecommunications

原文摘要:
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted
various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and
finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs
in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models
that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results
in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific
technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This
paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a
comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant
sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to
the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective
training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging
from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications
aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how
models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of
their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and
open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to
8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations
demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on
Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their
previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting
phenomenon.

大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现深刻影响了从自然语言处理到医疗、金融等多个领域。然而尽管其应用迅速扩展，LLMs在电信领域的应用仍局限于通用模型，缺乏专业领域的针对性适配。这种专业性的缺失导致模型表现欠佳，尤其在处理电信领域特有技术术语及其数学表达时更为明显。本文通过构建并开源Tele-Data（一个从相关资源整理的电信领域综合数据集）和Tele-Eval（针对该领域定制的大规模问答数据集），系统性地解决了这一空白。我们通过大量实验探索了将LLMs适配至电信领域的最有效训练技术，包括研究电信各子领域专业知识划分、应用参数高效微调方法等。同时分析了不同规模模型在领域适配过程中的行为差异，并揭示了其训练数据对适配效果的影响机制。基于这些发现，我们开发并开源了Tele-LLMs系列模型（参数量1B至8B），这是首个专为电信领域定制的语言模型体系。评估表明，该系列模型在Tele-Eval测试集及电信文献任务上显著优于通用模型，同时完全保留了原有能力，有效规避了灾难性遗忘现象。
