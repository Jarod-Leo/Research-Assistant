原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in the field
of natural language processing. However, the black-box nature of their internal
mechanisms has brought many concerns about their trustworthiness and
interpretability. Recent research has discovered a class of abnormal tokens in
the model's vocabulary space and named them "glitch tokens". Those tokens, once
included in the input, may induce the model to produce incorrect, irrelevant,
or even harmful results, drastically undermining the reliability and
practicality of LLMs.
  In this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of glitch tokens and
propose techniques for their detection and mitigation. We first reveal the
characteristic features induced by glitch tokens on LLMs, which are evidenced
by significant deviations in the distributions of attention patterns and
dynamic information from intermediate model layers. Based on the insights, we
develop GlitchProber, a tool for efficient glitch token detection and
mitigation. GlitchProber utilizes small-scale sampling, principal component
analysis for accelerated feature extraction, and a simple classifier for
efficient vocabulary screening. Taking one step further, GlitchProber rectifies
abnormal model intermediate layer values to mitigate the destructive effects of
glitch tokens. Evaluated on five mainstream open-source LLMs, GlitchProber
demonstrates higher efficiency, precision, and recall compared to existing
approaches, with an average F1 score of 0.86 and an average repair rate of
50.06%. GlitchProber unveils a novel path to address the challenges posed by
glitch tokens and inspires future research toward more robust and interpretable
LLMs.

大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理领域取得了前所未有的成功。然而，其内部机制的黑箱特性引发了对其可信度与可解释性的诸多担忧。近期研究发现模型词汇空间中存在一类异常标记，并将其命名为"故障标记"。这些标记一旦出现在输入中，可能诱导模型产生错误、无关甚至有害的输出，严重损害LLMs的可靠性与实用性。

本研究旨在深化对故障标记的理解，并提出其检测与缓解技术。我们首先揭示了故障标记在LLMs中诱发的特征现象，通过中间层注意力模式分布与动态信息的显著偏差予以验证。基于这些发现，我们开发了GlitchProber工具，用于高效检测与缓解故障标记。该工具采用小规模采样、主成分分析加速特征提取，并利用简单分类器实现高效词汇筛查。更进一步，GlitchProber通过修正模型中间层异常值来消除故障标记的破坏性影响。在五大主流开源LLMs上的评估表明，相较于现有方法，GlitchProber展现出更高效率、精确度与召回率，平均F1分数达0.86，平均修复率为50.06%。该工具为应对故障标记挑战开辟了新路径，并为构建更鲁棒、可解释的LLMs提供了研究启示。
