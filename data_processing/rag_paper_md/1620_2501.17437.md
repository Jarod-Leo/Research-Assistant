原文摘要:
Construction robotics increasingly relies on natural language processing for
task execution, creating a need for robust methods to interpret commands in
complex, dynamic environments. While existing research primarily focuses on
what tasks robots should perform, less attention has been paid to how these
tasks should be executed safely and efficiently. This paper presents a novel
probabilistic framework that uses sentiment analysis from natural language
commands to dynamically adjust robot navigation policies in construction
environments. The framework leverages Building Information Modeling (BIM) data
and natural language prompts to create adaptive navigation strategies that
account for varying levels of environmental risk and uncertainty. We introduce
an object-aware path planning approach that combines exponential potential
fields with a grid-based representation of the environment, where the potential
fields are dynamically adjusted based on the semantic analysis of user prompts.
The framework employs Bayesian inference to consolidate multiple information
sources: the static data from BIM, the semantic content of natural language
commands, and the implied safety constraints from user prompts. We demonstrate
our approach through experiments comparing three scenarios: baseline
shortest-path planning, safety-oriented navigation, and risk-aware routing.
Results show that our method successfully adapts path planning based on natural
language sentiment, achieving a 50\% improvement in minimum distance to
obstacles when safety is prioritized, while maintaining reasonable path
lengths. Scenarios with contrasting prompts, such as "dangerous" and "safe",
demonstrate the framework's ability to modify paths. This approach provides a
flexible foundation for integrating human knowledge and safety considerations
into construction robot navigation.

建筑机器人技术日益依赖自然语言处理来执行任务，这催生了对复杂动态环境中命令解析的鲁棒方法需求。现有研究主要关注机器人应执行何种任务，却较少探讨如何安全高效地执行这些任务。本文提出一种创新概率框架，通过分析自然语言指令的情感倾向，动态调整建筑环境中的机器人导航策略。该框架整合建筑信息模型（BIM）数据与自然语言提示，创建能适应不同环境风险等级的导航方案，并引入结合指数势场与网格化环境表征的物体感知路径规划方法——其中势场参数根据用户指令的语义分析动态调节。通过贝叶斯推理融合多源信息：BIM静态数据、自然语言指令的语义内容以及用户提示隐含的安全约束。实验通过对比三种场景验证方法有效性：基准最短路径规划、安全导向导航和风险感知路由。结果表明，本方法能根据自然语言情感成功调整路径规划，在优先考虑安全时使障碍物最小距离提升50%，同时保持合理路径长度。针对"危险"与"安全"等对立指令的场景测试，证实了框架修改路径的能力。该研究为将人类经验与安全考量融入建筑机器人导航提供了灵活的基础框架。
