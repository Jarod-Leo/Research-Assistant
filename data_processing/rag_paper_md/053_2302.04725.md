# Lightweight Transformers for Clinical Natural Language Processing

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04725v1

原文摘要:
Specialised pre-trained language models are becoming more frequent in NLP
since they can potentially outperform models trained on generic texts. BioBERT
and BioClinicalBERT are two examples of such models that have shown promise in
medical NLP tasks. Many of these models are overparametrised and
resource-intensive, but thanks to techniques like Knowledge Distillation (KD),
it is possible to create smaller versions that perform almost as well as their
larger counterparts. In this work, we specifically focus on development of
compact language models for processing clinical texts (i.e. progress notes,
discharge summaries etc). We developed a number of efficient lightweight
clinical transformers using knowledge distillation and continual learning, with
the number of parameters ranging from 15 million to 65 million. These models
performed comparably to larger models such as BioBERT and ClinicalBioBERT and
significantly outperformed other compact models trained on general or
biomedical data. Our extensive evaluation was done across several standard
datasets and covered a wide range of clinical text-mining tasks, including
Natural Language Inference, Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, and
Sequence Classification. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
study specifically focused on creating efficient and compact transformers for
clinical NLP tasks. The models and code used in this study can be found on our

随着专业预训练语言模型在自然语言处理领域日益普及，其表现往往优于通用文本训练的模型。BioBERT和BioClinicalBERT便是这类模型的典型代表，在医疗文本处理任务中展现出卓越潜力。尽管这些模型普遍存在参数冗余和资源消耗大的问题，但通过知识蒸馏等技术，我们能够构建性能接近原版的小型化模型。本研究聚焦于开发适用于临床文本（如病程记录、出院摘要等）处理的轻量级语言模型。

我们采用知识蒸馏与持续学习技术，成功开发出参数量介于1500万至6500万之间的高效临床文本Transformer模型系列。实验表明，这些模型在性能上可与BioBERT等大型模型媲美，并显著优于基于通用或生物医学数据训练的同类轻量模型。研究通过多标准数据集进行了全面评估，涵盖自然语言推理、关系抽取、命名实体识别及序列分类等临床文本挖掘核心任务。据我们所知，这是首个专门针对临床自然语言处理任务构建高效紧凑模型的系统性研究。
