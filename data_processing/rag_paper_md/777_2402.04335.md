# LegalLens: Leveraging LLMs for Legal Violation Identification in Unstructured Text

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04335v1

原文摘要:
In this study, we focus on two main tasks, the first for detecting legal
violations within unstructured textual data, and the second for associating
these violations with potentially affected individuals. We constructed two
datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) which were subsequently validated
by domain expert annotators. Both tasks were designed specifically for the
context of class-action cases. The experimental design incorporated fine-tuning
models from the BERT family and open-source LLMs, and conducting few-shot
experiments using closed-source LLMs. Our results, with an F1-score of 62.69\%
(violation identification) and 81.02\% (associating victims), show that our
datasets and setups can be used for both tasks. Finally, we publicly release
the datasets and the code used for the experiments in order to advance further
research in the area of legal natural language processing (NLP).

本研究聚焦于两项核心任务：一是从非结构化文本数据中识别违法行为，二是将这些违法行为与潜在受影响个体关联。我们利用大语言模型构建了两个专用数据集，并经领域专家标注验证。两项任务均针对集体诉讼场景专门设计，实验方案包括对BERT系列模型进行微调、采用开源大语言模型，以及使用闭源大语言模型进行小样本测试。最终取得的F1值分别为62.69%（违法行为识别）和81.02%（受害者关联），证明所构建数据集及实验设置可有效支持两项任务。为推进法律自然语言处理领域研究，我们已公开实验数据集及完整代码。
