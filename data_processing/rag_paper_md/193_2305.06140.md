# CrudeBERT: Applying Economic Theory towards fine-tuning Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis Models to the Crude Oil Market

原文摘要:
Predicting market movements based on the sentiment of news media has a long
tradition in data analysis. With advances in natural language processing,
transformer architectures have emerged that enable contextually aware sentiment
classification. Nevertheless, current methods built for the general financial
market such as FinBERT cannot distinguish asset-specific value-driving factors.
This paper addresses this shortcoming by presenting a method that identifies
and classifies events that impact supply and demand in the crude oil markets
within a large corpus of relevant news headlines. We then introduce CrudeBERT,
a new sentiment analysis model that draws upon these events to contextualize
and fine-tune FinBERT, thereby yielding improved sentiment classifications for
headlines related to the crude oil futures market. An extensive evaluation
demonstrates that CrudeBERT outperforms proprietary and open-source solutions
in the domain of crude oil.

基于新闻媒体情绪预测市场走势在数据分析领域有着悠久的传统。随着自然语言处理技术的进步，能够实现上下文感知情感分类的Transformer架构应运而生。然而当前针对通用金融市场开发的FinBERT等方法，无法区分资产特定的价值驱动因素。本文通过提出一种新方法来解决这一缺陷：首先从大量相关新闻标题中识别并分类影响原油市场供需的事件，进而引入CrudeBERT模型——该情感分析模型利用这些事件对FinBERT进行情境化微调，从而显著提升原油期货市场相关新闻标题的情感分类效果。大量评估实验表明，CrudeBERT在原油领域超越了专有和开源解决方案的性能表现。
