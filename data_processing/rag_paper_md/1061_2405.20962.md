# Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Next Location Predictors

原文摘要:
Predicting the locations an individual will visit in the future is crucial
for solving many societal issues like disease diffusion and reduction of
pollution. However, next-location predictors require a significant amount of
individual-level information that may be scarce or unavailable in some
scenarios (e.g., cold-start). Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown good
generalization and reasoning capabilities and are rich in geographical
knowledge, allowing us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot
next-location predictors. We tested more than 15 LLMs on three real-world
mobility datasets and we found that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 36.2%, a
significant relative improvement of almost 640% when compared to other models
specifically designed for human mobility. We also test for data contamination
and explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for
next-location prediction, showing that, regardless of the model size, LLMs can
explain their decision.

预测个体未来将访问的位置对于解决疾病传播、污染减少等诸多社会问题至关重要。然而，现有下一位置预测模型需要大量个体层级信息，在某些场景（如冷启动阶段）中这类数据往往稀缺或难以获取。大型语言模型（LLMs）已展现出优异的泛化推理能力和丰富的地理知识储备，这使我们有理由相信此类模型可作为零样本下一位置预测器。我们在三个真实世界移动数据集上测试了超过15个LLM，发现其最高准确率可达36.2%，相较于专为人类移动设计的模型实现了近640%的相对性能提升。研究同时检验了数据污染问题，并探索了将LLM作为基于文本的下一位置预测解释器的可能性，结果表明无论模型规模大小，LLM均能对其预测决策做出解释。
