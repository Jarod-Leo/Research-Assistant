# Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Next Location Predictors

原文摘要:
Predicting the locations an individual will visit in the future is crucial
for solving many societal issues like disease diffusion and reduction of
pollution. However, next-location predictors require a significant amount of
individual-level information that may be scarce or unavailable in some
scenarios (e.g., cold-start). Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown good
generalization and reasoning capabilities and are rich in geographical
knowledge, allowing us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot
next-location predictors. We tested more than 15 LLMs on three real-world
mobility datasets and we found that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 36.2%, a
significant relative improvement of almost 640% when compared to other models
specifically designed for human mobility. We also test for data contamination
and explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for
next-location prediction, showing that, regardless of the model size, LLMs can
explain their decision.

预测个体未来将访问的地点对于解决疾病传播和减少污染等众多社会问题至关重要。然而，现有下一位置预测模型需要大量个体层面信息，在某些场景（如冷启动）中这些数据可能稀缺或无法获取。大型语言模型（LLMs）展现出优异的泛化推理能力，并蕴含丰富的地理知识，这使我们有理由相信这些模型可作为零样本下一位置预测器。我们在三个真实世界移动数据集上测试了超过15个LLMs，发现其最高准确率可达36.2%，相较于专门设计的人类移动预测模型实现了近640%的相对性能提升。研究还检验了数据污染问题，并探索了将LLMs作为基于文本的下一位置预测解释器的可能性，结果表明无论模型规模大小，LLMs均能对其预测决策做出解释。
