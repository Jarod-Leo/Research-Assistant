原文摘要:
Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
proficiency in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including
machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and natural
language understanding.
  To further enhance the performance of LLMs in machine translation, we
conducted an investigation into two popular prompting methods and their
combination, focusing on cross-language combinations of Persian, English, and
Russian. We employed n-shot feeding and tailored prompting frameworks. Our
findings indicate that multilingual LLMs like PaLM exhibit human-like machine
translation outputs, enabling superior fine-tuning of desired translation
nuances in accordance with style guidelines and linguistic considerations.
These models also excel in processing and applying prompts. However, the choice
of language model, machine translation task, and the specific source and target
languages necessitate certain considerations when adopting prompting frameworks
and utilizing n-shot in-context learning.
  Furthermore, we identified errors and limitations inherent in popular LLMs as
machine translation tools and categorized them based on various linguistic
metrics. This typology of errors provides valuable insights for utilizing LLMs
effectively and offers methods for designing prompts for in-context learning.
Our report aims to contribute to the advancement of machine translation with
LLMs by improving both the accuracy and reliability of evaluation metrics.

生成式大型语言模型（LLM）在机器翻译、问答系统、文本摘要及自然语言理解等多项自然语言处理任务中展现出卓越能力。为提升LLM在机器翻译中的表现，本研究针对波斯语、英语和俄语的跨语言组合，系统考察了两种主流提示策略及其组合效果，采用n-shot输入与定制化提示框架。实验表明，如PaLM等多语言LLM能生成类人的翻译输出，可依据文体规范与语言学要素精细调整翻译细节，同时展现出优异的提示处理与应用能力。但需注意，语言模型选择、翻译任务特性及具体语言对等因素均会影响提示框架与n-shot上下文学习的效果。

研究还系统识别了主流LLM作为机器翻译工具存在的固有缺陷，并基于多维度语言学指标进行分类。该错误类型学不仅为LLM的有效使用提供了实践指导，更为上下文学习的提示设计提供了方法论支持。本报告通过优化评估指标的准确性与可靠性，旨在推动LLM在机器翻译领域的创新发展。
