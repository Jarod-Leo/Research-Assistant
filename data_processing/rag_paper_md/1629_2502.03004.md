原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
natural language processing tasks. However, their application to specialized
domains such as medicine and biology requires further optimization to ensure
factual accuracy, reliability, and contextual depth. We introduce MedBioLM, a
domain-adapted biomedical question-answering model designed to enhance both
short-form and long-form queries. By integrating fine-tuning and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), MedBioLM dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge, improving reasoning abilities and factual accuracy.
To evaluate its effectiveness, we fine-tuned the model on diverse biomedical QA
datasets, covering structured multiple-choice assessments and complex clinical
reasoning tasks. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy on benchmark
datasets, while RAG enhances factual consistency. These results highlight the
potential of domain-optimized LLMs in advancing biomedical research, medical
education, and clinical decision support.
