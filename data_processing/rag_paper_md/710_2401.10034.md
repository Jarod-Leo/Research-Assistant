原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have not only revolutionized natural language
processing but also extended their prowess to various domains, marking a
significant stride towards artificial general intelligence. The interplay
between LLMs and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), despite differing in objectives
and methodologies, share a common pursuit of applicability in complex problems.
Meanwhile, EA can provide an optimization framework for LLM's further
enhancement under black-box settings, empowering LLM with flexible global
search capacities. On the other hand, the abundant domain knowledge inherent in
LLMs could enable EA to conduct more intelligent searches. Furthermore, the
text processing and generative capabilities of LLMs would aid in deploying EAs
across a wide range of tasks. Based on these complementary advantages, this
paper provides a thorough review and a forward-looking roadmap, categorizing
the reciprocal inspiration into two main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA and
EA-enhanced LLM. Some integrated synergy methods are further introduced to
exemplify the complementarity between LLMs and EAs in diverse scenarios,
including code generation, software engineering, neural architecture search,
and various generation tasks. As the first comprehensive review focused on the
EA research in the era of LLMs, this paper provides a foundational stepping
stone for understanding the collaborative potential of LLMs and EAs. The
identified challenges and future directions offer guidance for researchers and
practitioners to unlock the full potential of this innovative collaboration in
propelling advancements in optimization and artificial intelligence. We have

大语言模型（LLMs）不仅彻底改变了自然语言处理领域，更将其强大能力拓展至多个学科，向通用人工智能迈出了重要一步。尽管LLMs与进化算法（EAs）在目标和方法上存在差异，但两者在解决复杂问题方面具有共同的适用性追求。一方面，EA能为黑箱环境下的LLM持续优化提供框架支持，赋予其灵活的全局搜索能力；另一方面，LLM内蕴的丰富领域知识可助力EA实现更智能的搜索过程。此外，LLM的文本处理与生成能力有助于EA在多样化任务中的部署应用。基于这些互补优势，本文系统梳理了双向赋能的两大研究路径——LLM增强型EA与EA增强型LLM，并提出了前瞻性路线图。通过代码生成、软件工程、神经架构搜索及多模态生成等场景下的协同方法案例，深入阐释了LLMs与EAs的互补机制。作为首篇聚焦LLM时代的EA研究综述，本文为理解两者协同潜力奠定了理论基础，所揭示的挑战与未来方向将为学界与业界提供指引，推动这一创新融合在优化与人工智能领域释放全部潜能。我们已建立GitHub仓库索引相关论文：https://github.com/wuxingyu-ai/LLM4EC。
