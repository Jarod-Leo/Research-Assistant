原文摘要:
Knowledge graphs (KG) have served as the key component of various natural
language processing applications. Commonsense knowledge graphs (CKG) are a
special type of KG, where entities and relations are composed of free-form
text. However, previous works in KG completion and CKG completion suffer from
long-tail relations and newly-added relations which do not have many know
triples for training. In light of this, few-shot KG completion (FKGC), which
requires the strengths of graph representation learning and few-shot learning,
has been proposed to challenge the problem of limited annotated data. In this
paper, we comprehensively survey previous attempts on such tasks in the form of
a series of methods and applications. Specifically, we first introduce FKGC
challenges, commonly used KGs, and CKGs. Then we systematically categorize and
summarize existing works in terms of the type of KGs and the methods. Finally,
we present applications of FKGC models on prediction tasks in different areas
and share our thoughts on future research directions of FKGC.

知识图谱（KG）已成为各类自然语言处理应用的核心组件。常识知识图谱（CKG）作为一种特殊类型的KG，其实体与关系均由自由文本构成。然而，传统知识图谱补全与常识知识图谱补全研究长期受限于长尾关系及新增关系训练三元组不足的困境。为此，融合图表示学习与小样本学习技术的少样本知识图谱补全（FKGC）方法被提出以应对标注数据稀缺的挑战。本文以系列方法与应用为脉络，系统梳理了该领域的相关研究进展：首先阐述FKGC的任务难点、常用知识图谱及常识知识图谱特性；继而从知识图谱类型与方法论两个维度对现有工作进行了体系化分类与总结；最后展示了FKGC模型在不同领域预测任务中的应用实践，并展望了未来研究方向。
