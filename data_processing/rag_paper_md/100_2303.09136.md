原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have transformed many fields, including natural
language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. These models
have also made a significant impact in the field of law, where they are being
increasingly utilized to automate various legal tasks, such as legal judgement
prediction, legal document analysis, and legal document writing. However, the
integration of LLMs into the legal field has also raised several legal
problems, including privacy concerns, bias, and explainability. In this survey,
we explore the integration of LLMs into the field of law. We discuss the
various applications of LLMs in legal tasks, examine the legal challenges that
arise from their use, and explore the data resources that can be used to
specialize LLMs in the legal domain. Finally, we discuss several promising
directions and conclude this paper. By doing so, we hope to provide an overview
of the current state of LLMs in law and highlight the potential benefits and
challenges of their integration.

大语言模型（LLMs）已深刻变革了自然语言处理、计算机视觉和强化学习等多个领域。这些模型在法律领域同样产生了显著影响，正被日益广泛地应用于法律判决预测、法律文书分析和法律文件撰写等任务的自动化。然而，LLMs与法律领域的融合也引发了隐私保护、算法偏见和可解释性等多重法律问题。本文系统梳理了LLMs在法律领域的整合应用：首先阐述LLMs在法律任务中的多样化应用场景，继而剖析其应用过程中产生的法律挑战，并探讨适用于法律领域LLMs专业化的数据资源。最后，我们展望了若干具有发展前景的研究方向。通过这项研究，旨在全面呈现LLMs在法律领域的应用现状，同时揭示其融合过程中潜在的机遇与挑战。
