原文摘要:
Computing high dimensional potential surfaces for molecular and materials
systems is considered to be a great challenge in computational chemistry with
potential impact in a range of areas including fundamental prediction of
reaction rates. In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has
similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language
processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which
contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets,
which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the
potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51
dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the
graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We
then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be
transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential
surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results
for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher
dimensional potential surface problem.

计算分子与材料体系的高维势能面被视为计算化学领域的重大挑战，其潜在影响涵盖反应速率基础预测等多个方面。本文设计并探讨了一种与生成式人工智能及自然语言处理中的大语言模型具有相似性的算法。具体而言，我们将分子系统表示为包含节点、边、面等要素的图结构。这些要素集合（代表分子子系统）之间的相互作用，被用于构建具有51个维度的中等规模化学体系的势能面。本质上，一组基于图子系统的神经网络成功完成了这个51维系统的建模工作。随后我们探究：这组低维神经网络能否通过转换，为186维势能面提供精确预测。研究发现，该算法确实能在这个更高维度的势能面问题上给出合理精确的结果，误差控制在亚千卡/摩尔级别。
