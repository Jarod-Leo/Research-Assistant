原文摘要:
There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical
reasoning. Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning
falls short of expectations. Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make
clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's
cognitive processes. This leads to user distrust. In this paper, we present a
multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based
agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction.
ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme
for Clinical Discussion (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes
in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a
directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, use symbolic
solver to identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support
decision. We construct a formal model of ArgMed-Agents and present conjectures
for theoretical guarantees. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of
clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a
self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only
improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to
other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision
explanations that increase their confidence.

在临床推理中应用大语言模型(LLMs)主要存在两大障碍。首先，尽管LLMs在自然语言处理(NLP)任务中展现出显著潜力，但其在复杂推理与规划方面的表现仍不尽如人意。其次，LLMs采用与临床医生认知过程本质不同的不可解释方法进行临床决策，这导致用户信任度降低。本文提出名为ArgMed-Agents的多智能体框架，旨在通过交互使基于LLM的智能体实现可解释的临床决策推理。ArgMed-Agents通过临床讨论论证方案(一种用于建模临床推理认知过程的推理机制)进行自我论证迭代，随后将论证过程构建为表示冲突关系的有向图。最终采用符号求解器识别一系列合理连贯的论证来支持决策。我们构建了ArgMed-Agents的形式化模型并提出理论保证的猜想。该框架使LLMs能够通过自主生成推理解释来模拟临床论证推理过程。实验表明，与其他提示方法相比，ArgMed-Agents不仅提升了复杂临床决策推理问题的准确率，更重要的是为用户提供了增强决策信心的解释说明。
