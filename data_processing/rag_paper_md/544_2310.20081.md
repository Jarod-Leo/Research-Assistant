原文摘要:
Personalization, the ability to tailor a system to individual users, is an
essential factor in user experience with natural language processing (NLP)
systems. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question is
how to leverage these models to better personalize user experiences. To
personalize a language model's output, a straightforward approach is to
incorporate past user data into the language model prompt, but this approach
can result in lengthy inputs exceeding limitations on input length and
incurring latency and cost issues. Existing approaches tackle such challenges
by selectively extracting relevant user data (i.e. selective retrieval) to
construct a prompt for downstream tasks. However, retrieval-based methods are
limited by potential information loss, lack of more profound user
understanding, and cold-start challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel summary-augmented approach by extending retrieval-augmented
personalization with task-aware user summaries generated by LLMs. The summaries
can be generated and stored offline, enabling real-world systems with runtime
constraints like voice assistants to leverage the power of LLMs. Experiments
show our method with 75% less of retrieved user data is on-par or outperforms
retrieval augmentation on most tasks in the LaMP personalization benchmark. We
demonstrate that offline summarization via LLMs and runtime retrieval enables
better performance for personalization on a range of tasks under practical
constraints.

个性化——即根据个体用户需求定制系统的能力，是影响自然语言处理（NLP）系统用户体验的关键因素。随着大语言模型（LLM）的兴起，如何利用这些模型优化个性化体验成为核心议题。传统方法直接将用户历史数据嵌入模型提示词，但会导致输入长度超限，引发延迟和成本问题。现有解决方案通过选择性提取相关用户数据（即选择性检索）构建任务提示，但存在信息丢失、用户理解浅层及冷启动等局限。

为突破这些限制，我们创新性地提出摘要增强方法：利用LLM生成的任务感知型用户摘要扩展检索增强的个性化方案。这些摘要可离线生成存储，使语音助手等实时性要求高的系统能充分发挥LLM效能。实验表明，在LaMP个性化基准测试中，我们的方法仅需25%检索数据量即可在多数任务上达到或超越检索增强效果。研究证实，通过LLM离线摘要与运行时检索的结合，能在实际约束条件下为各类任务提供更优的个性化性能。
