# Narratives from GPT-derived Networks of News, and a link to Financial Markets Dislocations

原文摘要:
Starting from a corpus of economic articles from The Wall Street Journal, we
present a novel systematic way to analyse news content that evolves over time.
We leverage on state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques (i.e.
GPT3.5) to extract the most important entities of each article available, and
aggregate co-occurrence of entities in a related graph at the weekly level.
Network analysis techniques and fuzzy community detection are tested on the
proposed set of graphs, and a framework is introduced that allows systematic
but interpretable detection of topics and narratives. In parallel, we propose
to consider the sentiment around main entities of an article as a more accurate
proxy for the overall sentiment of such piece of text, and describe a
case-study to motivate this choice. Finally, we design features that
characterise the type and structure of news within each week, and map them to
moments of financial markets dislocations. The latter are identified as dates
with unusually high volatility across asset classes, and we find quantitative
evidence that they relate to instances of high entropy in the high-dimensional
space of interconnected news. This result further motivates the pursued efforts
to provide a novel framework for the systematic analysis of narratives within
news.

我们以《华尔街日报》的经济类文章为语料库，提出了一种分析随时间演变的新闻内容的系统性新方法。通过运用前沿的自然语言处理技术（如GPT3.5），我们提取每篇文章中最关键的实体，并在周度层面构建实体共现关系网络图。在该网络图集上，我们测试了网络分析技术与模糊社区检测算法，并引入一个兼具系统性和可解释性的主题叙事检测框架。

同时，我们创新性地提出以文章核心实体相关情感作为全文情感倾向的更精准代理指标，并通过案例研究论证了这一选择的合理性。最后，我们设计了一组能表征每周新闻类型与结构特征的特征向量，并将其映射至金融市场异常波动时期。这些时期被定义为跨资产类别波动率异常高的时间节点，定量分析显示它们与高维关联新闻空间中信息熵激增的时段存在显著关联。这一发现进一步验证了我们开发新闻叙事系统性分析新框架的研究价值。
