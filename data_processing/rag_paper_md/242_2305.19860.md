原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have recently gained significant
attention in the domain of Recommendation Systems (RS). These models, trained
on massive amounts of data using self-supervised learning, have demonstrated
remarkable success in learning universal representations and have the potential
to enhance various aspects of recommendation systems by some effective transfer
techniques such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning, and so on. The crucial aspect
of harnessing the power of language models in enhancing recommendation quality
is the utilization of their high-quality representations of textual features
and their extensive coverage of external knowledge to establish correlations
between items and users. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the
existing LLM-based recommendation systems, this survey presents a taxonomy that
categorizes these models into two major paradigms, respectively Discriminative
LLM for Recommendation (DLLM4Rec) and Generative LLM for Recommendation
(GLLM4Rec), with the latter being systematically sorted out for the first time.
Furthermore, we systematically review and analyze existing LLM-based
recommendation systems within each paradigm, providing insights into their
methodologies, techniques, and performance. Additionally, we identify key
challenges and several valuable findings to provide researchers and
practitioners with inspiration. We have also created a GitHub repository to
index relevant papers on LLMs for recommendation,

大语言模型（LLMs）已成为自然语言处理（NLP）领域的强大工具，并近期在推荐系统（RS）领域获得显著关注。这些模型通过自监督学习在海量数据上训练，展现了学习通用表征的卓越能力，并有望通过微调、提示调优等有效迁移技术提升推荐系统的多个方面。利用语言模型提升推荐质量的核心在于发挥其高质量文本特征表征能力与广泛外部知识覆盖范围，从而建立物品与用户间的关联。  

为全面理解现有基于LLM的推荐系统，本综述提出了一种分类体系，将相关模型划分为两大范式：判别式LLM推荐（DLLM4Rec）与生成式LLM推荐（GLLM4Rec），其中后者为首次被系统梳理。我们分别对两类范式下的现有研究进行了系统性回顾与分析，阐释其方法论、技术实现与性能表现。此外，本文提炼出关键挑战与若干重要发现，为研究者和实践者提供启示。相关论文资源已整理至GitHub仓库：https://github.com/WLiK/LLM4Rec。
