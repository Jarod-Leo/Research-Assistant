原文摘要:
In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has become increasingly
important in a variety of business applications, including sentiment analysis,
text classification, and named entity recognition. In this paper, we propose an
approach for company classification using NLP and zero-shot learning. Our
method utilizes pre-trained transformer models to extract features from company
descriptions, and then applies zero-shot learning to classify companies into
relevant categories without the need for specific training data for each
category. We evaluate our approach on a dataset obtained through the Wharton
Research Data Services (WRDS), which comprises textual descriptions of publicly
traded companies. We demonstrate that the approach can streamline the process
of company classification, thereby reducing the time and resources required in
traditional approaches such as the Global Industry Classification Standard
(GICS). The results show that this method has potential for automation of
company classification, making it a promising avenue for future research in
this area.

近年来，自然语言处理（NLP）在情感分析、文本分类和命名实体识别等多种商业应用中日益重要。本文提出了一种结合NLP与零样本学习的公司分类方法。该方法利用预训练的Transformer模型从公司描述文本中提取特征，随后通过零样本学习将公司划分至相关类别，无需针对每个类别准备特定训练数据。我们在沃顿研究数据服务（WRDS）提供的上市公司文本描述数据集上进行了评估，结果表明该方法能有效简化公司分类流程，显著降低传统行业分类标准（如GICS）所需的时间与资源成本。实验证明该技术在公司分类自动化方面具有应用潜力，为这一领域的后续研究提供了可行方向。
