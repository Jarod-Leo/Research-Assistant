# Fuzzy Fingerprinting Transformer Language-Models for Emotion Recognition in Conversations

原文摘要:
Fuzzy Fingerprints have been successfully used as an interpretable text
classification technique, but, like most other techniques, have been largely
surpassed in performance by Large Pre-trained Language Models, such as BERT or
RoBERTa. These models deliver state-of-the-art results in several Natural
Language Processing tasks, namely Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC),
but suffer from the lack of interpretability and explainability. In this paper,
we propose to combine the two approaches to perform ERC, as a means to obtain
simpler and more interpretable Large Language Models-based classifiers. We
propose to feed the utterances and their previous conversational turns to a
pre-trained RoBERTa, obtaining contextual embedding utterance representations,
that are then supplied to an adapted Fuzzy Fingerprint classification module.
We validate our approach on the widely used DailyDialog ERC benchmark dataset,
in which we obtain state-of-the-art level results using a much lighter model.

模糊指纹技术作为一种可解释的文本分类方法曾取得显著成效，但与BERT、RoBERTa等大型预训练语言模型相比，其性能已明显落后。这些模型在自然语言处理任务（尤其是对话情绪识别ERC）中展现出最先进的表现，却存在可解释性不足的缺陷。本文提出将两种方法相结合进行ERC任务，旨在构建更简洁且可解释性更强的大型语言模型分类器。具体方案是：将当前话语及其历史对话轮次输入预训练的RoBERTa模型，获取上下文嵌入的语句表征，再将其输入改进的模糊指纹分类模块。我们在广泛使用的DailyDialog ERC基准数据集上验证了该方法，结果表明该轻量化模型达到了当前最优性能水平。
