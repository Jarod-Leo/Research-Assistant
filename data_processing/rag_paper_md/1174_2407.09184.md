# Does Incomplete Syntax Influence Korean Language Model? Focusing on Word Order and Case Markers

原文摘要:
Syntactic elements, such as word order and case markers, are fundamental in
natural language processing. Recent studies show that syntactic information
boosts language model performance and offers clues for people to understand
their learning mechanisms. Unlike languages with a fixed word order such as
English, Korean allows for varied word sequences, despite its canonical
structure, due to case markers that indicate the functions of sentence
components. This study explores whether Korean language models can accurately
capture this flexibility. We note that incomplete word orders and omitted case
markers frequently appear in ordinary Korean communication. To investigate this
further, we introduce the Syntactically Incomplete Korean (SIKO) dataset.
Through SIKO, we assessed Korean language models' flexibility with incomplete
syntax and confirmed the dataset's training value. Results indicate these
models reflect Korean's inherent flexibility, accurately handling incomplete
inputs. Moreover, fine-tuning with SIKO enhances the ability to handle common
incomplete Korean syntactic forms. The dataset's simple construction process,
coupled with significant performance enhancements, solidifies its standing as
an effective data augmentation technique.

句法要素，如词序和格标记，是自然语言处理的基础。最新研究表明，句法信息不仅能提升语言模型性能，还为人们理解其学习机制提供了线索。与英语等词序固定的语言不同，韩语虽具有规范结构，但因格标记能明确句子成分功能，允许词序灵活变化。本研究探讨韩语模型能否准确捕捉这种灵活性。我们注意到，日常韩语交流中常出现不完整词序和省略格标记的现象。为此，我们构建了"句法不完整韩语数据集"(SIKO)，通过该数据集评估了韩语模型处理不完整句法的灵活性，并验证了其训练价值。实验结果表明，现有模型能准确处理不完整输入，体现了韩语的内在灵活性。经SIKO微调后，模型处理常见不完整句法形式的能力显著提升。该数据集构建流程简便且能带来显著性能改进，证实其作为高效数据增强技术的实用价值。
