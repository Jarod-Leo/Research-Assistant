原文摘要:
Language models now constitute essential tools for improving efficiency for
many professional tasks such as writing, coding, or learning. For this reason,
it is imperative to identify inherent biases. In the field of Natural Language
Processing, five sources of bias are well-identified: data, annotation,
representation, models, and research design. This study focuses on biases
related to geographical knowledge. We explore the connection between geography
and language models by highlighting their tendency to misrepresent spatial
information, thus leading to distortions in the representation of geographical
distances. This study introduces four indicators to assess these distortions,
by comparing geographical and semantic distances. Experiments are conducted
from these four indicators with ten widely used language models. Results
underscore the critical necessity of inspecting and rectifying spatial biases
in language models to ensure accurate and equitable representations.

语言模型已成为提升写作、编程及学习等多项专业任务效率的关键工具，因此识别其固有偏见至关重要。在自然语言处理领域，学界已明确识别出五类偏见来源：数据、标注、表征、模型及研究设计。本研究聚焦于地理知识相关的偏见，通过揭示语言模型在空间信息表征上的失真现象，探讨其与地理学之间的关联，这种失真尤其体现在地理距离的扭曲表征上。为此，我们提出四项评估指标，通过对比地理距离与语义距离来量化此类偏差。实验选取十种常用语言模型，基于四项指标展开系统性评测。研究结果凸显了检测与修正语言模型中空间偏见的紧迫性，以确保其表征的准确性与公平性。
