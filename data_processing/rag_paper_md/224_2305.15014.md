原文摘要:
The temporal aspect is a significant dimension of our reality. We notice the
challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal
reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the
generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and
program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of
complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to
the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this
problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for
temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic
incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction,
and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning
tasks.

时间维度是我们现实世界的重要构成部分。研究发现，大语言模型在处理时序推理任务时面临显著挑战。初步实验表明，思维链、程序辅助语言模型等中间推理步骤生成方法，对提升复杂时序问答任务的性能并不具有普适性，这主要源于模型对时序信息理解能力的不足。为此，我们提出TempLogic框架，专门针对三个推理层级的时序问答任务，创新性地融合了检索引导的上下文蒸馏、时序数据提取和定制化逻辑推理机制。大量实验与分析验证了该框架在解决复杂时间约束推理任务时的有效性。
