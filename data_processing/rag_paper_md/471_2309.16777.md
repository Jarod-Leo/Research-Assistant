原文摘要:
The introduction of ChatGPT has put Artificial Intelligence (AI) Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in the spotlight. ChatGPT adoption has been
exponential with millions of users experimenting with it in a myriad of tasks
and application domains with impressive results. However, ChatGPT has
limitations and suffers hallucinations, for example producing answers that look
plausible but they are completely wrong. Evaluating the performance of ChatGPT
and similar AI tools is a complex issue that is being explored from different
perspectives. In this work, we contribute to those efforts with ChatWords, an
automated test system, to evaluate ChatGPT knowledge of an arbitrary set of
words. ChatWords is designed to be extensible, easy to use, and adaptable to
evaluate also other NLP AI tools. ChatWords is publicly available and its main
goal is to facilitate research on the lexical knowledge of AI tools. The
benefits of ChatWords are illustrated with two case studies: evaluating the
knowledge that ChatGPT has of the Spanish lexicon (taken from the official
dictionary of the "Real Academia Espa\~nola") and of the words that appear in
the Quixote, the well-known novel written by Miguel de Cervantes. The results
show that ChatGPT is only able to recognize approximately 80% of the words in
the dictionary and 90% of the words in the Quixote, in some cases with an
incorrect meaning. The implications of the lexical knowledge of NLP AI tools
and potential applications of ChatWords are also discussed providing directions
for further work on the study of the lexical knowledge of AI tools.

ChatGPT的推出使人工智能（AI）自然语言处理（NLP）成为焦点。其采用率呈指数级增长，数百万用户在各种任务和应用领域进行测试并取得了令人印象深刻的效果。然而，ChatGPT存在局限性且会出现幻觉现象，例如生成看似合理实则完全错误的答案。评估ChatGPT及类似AI工具的性能是一个复杂议题，目前正从多角度展开探索。本研究通过开发ChatWords自动化测试系统对此作出贡献，该系统可评估ChatGPT对任意词汇集的掌握程度。ChatWords具有可扩展性、易用性等特点，并能适配其他NLP AI工具的评估需求。该工具已公开可用，主要目标是促进AI工具词汇知识的相关研究。我们通过两个案例研究展示ChatWords的应用价值：一是评估ChatGPT对西班牙皇家学院官方词典词汇的掌握情况，二是分析其对塞万提斯名著《堂吉诃德》中词汇的识别能力。结果表明，ChatGPT仅能识别约80%的词典词汇和90%的小说词汇，且存在释义错误的情况。本文还探讨了NLP AI工具词汇知识的影响、ChatWords的潜在应用方向，并为AI工具词汇知识的后续研究提供了建议。
