原文摘要:
While modern Requirements Engineering (RE) heavily relies on natural language
processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, their effectiveness is limited
by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This paper introduces Synthline, a
Product Line (PL) approach that leverages Large Language Models to
systematically generate synthetic RE data for classification-based use cases.
Through an empirical evaluation conducted in the context of using ML for the
identification of requirements specification defects, we investigated both the
diversity of the generated data and its utility for training downstream models.
Our analysis reveals that while synthetic datasets exhibit less diversity than
real data, they are good enough to serve as viable training resources.
Moreover, our evaluation shows that combining synthetic and real data leads to
substantial performance improvements. Specifically, hybrid approaches achieve
up to 85% improvement in precision and a 2x increase in recall compared to
models trained exclusively on real data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of PL-based synthetic data generation to address data scarcity in RE.
We make both our implementation and generated datasets publicly available to
support reproducibility and advancement in the field.

尽管现代需求工程（RE）高度依赖自然语言处理与机器学习（ML）技术，但其效果常受限于高质量数据集的稀缺性。本文提出Synthline——一种基于产品线（PL）的方法，通过大语言模型系统化生成适用于分类用例的合成需求数据。在以ML识别需求规范缺陷为背景的实证评估中，我们既考察了生成数据的多样性，也验证了其用于下游模型训练的有效性。分析表明：虽然合成数据集多样性弱于真实数据，但其质量足以作为可靠的训练资源；更重要的是，混合使用合成与真实数据能带来显著性能提升——相较于纯真实数据训练的模型，混合方法在精确度上最高提升85%，召回率实现翻倍。这些发现证实了基于PL的合成数据生成对缓解RE领域数据短缺问题的潜力。我们公开了实现代码与生成数据集，以支持研究可复现性及领域发展。
