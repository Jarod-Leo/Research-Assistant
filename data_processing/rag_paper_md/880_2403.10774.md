原文摘要:
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled natural
language processing capabilities similar to those of humans, and LLMs are being
widely utilized across various societal domains such as education and
healthcare. While the versatility of these models has increased, they have the
potential to generate subjective and normative language, leading to
discriminatory treatment or outcomes among social groups, especially due to
online offensive language. In this paper, we define such harm as societal bias
and assess ethnic, gender, and racial biases in a model fine-tuned with Korean
comments using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KcBERT)
and KOLD data through template-based Masked Language Modeling (MLM). To
quantitatively evaluate biases, we employ LPBS and CBS metrics. Compared to
KcBERT, the fine-tuned model shows a reduction in ethnic bias but demonstrates
significant changes in gender and racial biases. Based on these results, we
propose two methods to mitigate societal bias. Firstly, a data balancing
approach during the pre-training phase adjusts the uniformity of data by
aligning the distribution of the occurrences of specific words and converting
surrounding harmful words into non-harmful words. Secondly, during the
in-training phase, we apply Debiasing Regularization by adjusting dropout and
regularization, confirming a decrease in training loss. Our contribution lies
in demonstrating that societal bias exists in Korean language models due to
language-dependent characteristics.

大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展使其具备了类人的自然语言处理能力，并广泛应用于教育、医疗等社会各领域。尽管模型的多功能性有所提升，但它们可能生成带有主观性和规范性的语言，导致社会群体间的不平等待遇或结果，尤其是网络攻击性言论加剧了这一现象。本文将此类危害定义为社会偏见，并通过基于模板的掩码语言建模（MLM）方法，利用韩国评论数据微调的KcBERT模型和KOLD数据集，评估了民族、性别和种族偏见。为量化评估偏见程度，我们采用LPBS和CBS指标。与KcBERT相比，微调后的模型显示民族偏见有所减少，但性别和种族偏见出现显著变化。基于这些发现，我们提出两种缓解社会偏见的方案：首先在预训练阶段采用数据平衡策略，通过调整特定词汇出现频次的分布，并将周边有害词汇转化为无害表达来优化数据均匀性；其次在训练过程中应用去偏正则化技术，通过调整dropout和正则化参数，验证了训练损失的降低。本研究的创新点在于揭示了韩语语言模型中存在依赖语言特性的社会偏见现象。
