# Benchmarking Large Language Models on Communicative Medical Coaching: a Novel System and Dataset

原文摘要:
Traditional applications of natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare
have predominantly focused on patient-centered services, enhancing patient
interactions and care delivery, such as through medical dialogue systems.
However, the potential of NLP to benefit inexperienced doctors, particularly in
areas such as communicative medical coaching, remains largely unexplored. We
introduce "ChatCoach", a human-AI cooperative framework designed to assist
medical learners in practicing their communication skills during patient
consultations. ChatCoach (Our data and code are available online:
https://github.com/zerowst/Chatcoach)differentiates itself from conventional
dialogue systems by offering a simulated environment where medical learners can
practice dialogues with a patient agent, while a coach agent provides
immediate, structured feedback. This is facilitated by our proposed Generalized
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) approach, which fosters the generation of structured
feedback and enhances the utilization of external knowledge sources.
Additionally, we have developed a dataset specifically for evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) within the ChatCoach framework on communicative medical
coaching tasks. Our empirical results validate the effectiveness of ChatCoach.

传统自然语言处理（NLP）在医疗领域的应用主要集中于以患者为中心的服务，通过医疗对话系统等提升患者互动与护理质量。然而，NLP在辅助经验不足医生方面的潜力——特别是在沟通式医疗指导等领域——仍待深入探索。我们提出"ChatCoach"这一人机协作框架，旨在帮助医学生在患者问诊过程中训练沟通技能。该框架（数据与代码已开源：https://github.com/zerowst/Chatcoach）区别于传统对话系统的核心在于：通过模拟问诊场景让医学生与患者智能体对话，同时由指导智能体提供即时结构化反馈。这一机制依托于我们提出的广义思维链（GCoT）方法，该方法不仅能促进结构化反馈的生成，还增强了外部知识源的调用能力。此外，我们专门构建了评估数据集，用于测试大语言模型在ChatCoach框架下执行医疗沟通指导任务的表现。实证结果验证了该框架的有效性。
