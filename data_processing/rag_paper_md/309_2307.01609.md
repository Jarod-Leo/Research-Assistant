原文摘要:
Grammatical error correction is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural
Language Processing. For the Russian language, most of the spellcheckers
available correct typos and other simple errors with high accuracy, but often
fail when faced with non-native (L2) writing, since the latter contains errors
that are not typical for native speakers. In this paper, we propose a pipeline
involving a language model intended for correcting errors in L2 Russian
writing. The language model proposed is trained on untagged texts of the
Newspaper subcorpus of the Russian National Corpus, and the quality of the
model is validated against the RULEC-GEC corpus.

语法错误纠正是自然语言处理中的基础任务之一。针对俄语，现有的大部分拼写检查工具能够高精度修正打字错误等简单问题，但在处理非母语者（L2）文本时往往表现不佳，因为这类文本包含母语者不典型的错误模式。本研究提出了一种基于语言模型的处理流程，专门用于修正L2俄语写作中的错误。该语言模型以俄罗斯国家语料库中报纸子库的无标注文本进行训练，并通过RULEC-GEC语料库验证了模型质量。
