原文摘要:
In this study, we introduce CIKMar, an efficient approach to educational
dialogue systems powered by the Gemma Language model. By leveraging a
Dual-Encoder ranking system that incorporates both BERT and SBERT model, we
have designed CIKMar to deliver highly relevant and accurate responses, even
with the constraints of a smaller language model size. Our evaluation reveals
that CIKMar achieves a robust recall and F1-score of 0.70 using BERTScore
metrics. However, we have identified a significant challenge: the Dual-Encoder
tends to prioritize theoretical responses over practical ones. These findings
underscore the potential of compact and efficient models like Gemma in
democratizing access to advanced educational AI systems, ensuring effective and
contextually appropriate responses.

本研究提出了一种基于Gemma语言模型的高效教育对话系统方法——CIKMar。通过结合BERT和SBERT模型的双编码器排序系统，我们设计的CIKMar即使在较小语言模型规模的限制下，仍能提供高度相关且准确的响应。评估结果显示，采用BERTScore指标时，CIKMar实现了0.70的稳健召回率和F1分数。但我们发现一个重要挑战：双编码器系统倾向于优先选择理论性回答而非实用性回答。这些发现凸显了Gemma等紧凑高效模型在普及先进教育AI系统方面的潜力，能够确保生成有效且符合语境的响应。
