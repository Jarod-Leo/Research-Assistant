原文摘要:
Ontology alignment, a critical process in the Semantic Web for detecting
relationships between different ontologies, has traditionally focused on
identifying so-called "simple" 1-to-1 relationships through class labels and
properties comparison. The more practically useful exploration of more complex
alignments remains a hard problem to automate, and as such is largely
underexplored, i.e. in application practice it is usually done manually by
ontology and domain experts. Recently, the surge in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) capabilities, driven by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs),
presents new opportunities for enhancing ontology engineering practices,
including ontology alignment tasks. This paper investigates the application of
LLM technologies to tackle the complex ontology alignment challenge. Leveraging
a prompt-based approach and integrating rich ontology content so-called modules
our work constitutes a significant advance towards automating the complex
alignment task.

本体对齐作为语义网中检测不同本体间关系的关键过程，传统上主要通过类标签与属性比较来识别所谓的"简单"一对一关系。而对更具实用价值的复杂对齐模式的探索，至今仍是难以实现自动化的难题，因此在应用实践中通常由本体和领域专家手动完成。近年来，随着大语言模型（LLM）推动的自然语言处理（NLP）能力突飞猛进，为包括本体对齐在内的本体工程实践带来了新的机遇。本文研究如何应用LLM技术应对复杂本体对齐挑战，通过采用基于提示词的方法并整合丰富的本体内容模块，我们的工作为实现复杂对齐任务的自动化迈出了重要一步。
