原文摘要:
With the accelerating development of Large Language Models (LLMs), many LLMs
are beginning to be used in the Chinese K-12 education domain. The integration
of LLMs and education is getting closer and closer, however, there is currently
no benchmark for evaluating LLMs that focuses on the Chinese K-12 education
domain. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive natural language
processing benchmark to accurately assess the capabilities of various LLMs in
the Chinese K-12 education domain. To address this, we introduce the E-EVAL,
the first comprehensive evaluation benchmark specifically designed for the
Chinese K-12 education field. The E-EVAL consists of 4,351 multiple-choice
questions at the primary, middle, and high school levels across a wide range of
subjects, including Chinese, English, Politics, History, Ethics, Physics,
Chemistry, Mathematics, and Geography. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation
of E-EVAL on advanced LLMs, including both English-dominant and
Chinese-dominant models. Findings show that Chinese-dominant models perform
well compared to English-dominant models, with many scoring even above the GPT
4.0. However, almost all models perform poorly in complex subjects such as
mathematics. We also found that most Chinese-dominant LLMs did not achieve
higher scores at the primary school level compared to the middle school level.
We observe that the mastery of higher-order knowledge by the model does not
necessarily imply the mastery of lower-order knowledge as well. Additionally,
the experimental results indicate that the Chain of Thought (CoT) technique is
effective only for the challenging science subjects, while Few-shot prompting
is more beneficial for liberal arts subjects. With E-EVAL, we aim to analyze
the strengths and limitations of LLMs in educational applications, and to
contribute to the progress and development of Chinese K-12 education and LLMs.

随着大语言模型（LLMs）的加速发展，众多LLM开始应用于中国K12教育领域。LLM与教育的融合日益紧密，然而目前尚缺乏针对中国K12教育领域的LLM评估基准。因此，亟需一个全面的自然语言处理基准来准确衡量各类LLM在中国K12教育领域的能力。为此，我们推出首个专为中国K12教育领域设计的综合性评估基准E-EVAL。该基准包含4,351道涵盖小学、初中及高中阶段的多选题，涉及语文、英语、政治、历史、道德与法治、物理、化学、数学、地理等广泛学科。我们对包括英文主导与中文主导模型在内的先进LLM进行了全面评估。研究发现，中文主导模型表现优于英文主导模型，部分模型得分甚至超越GPT 4.0。但几乎所有模型在数学等复杂学科上表现欠佳。我们还发现多数中文LLM在小学阶段的得分并未超过初中阶段，这表明模型对高阶知识的掌握并不必然意味着对低阶知识的精通。此外，实验结果表明思维链（CoT）技术仅对难度较高的理科有效，而少样本提示（Few-shot prompting）则更有利于文科表现。通过E-EVAL，我们旨在剖析LLM在教育应用中的优势与局限，推动中国K12教育与LLM的共同进步与发展。
