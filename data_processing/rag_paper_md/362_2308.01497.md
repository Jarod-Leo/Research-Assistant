原文摘要:
Recent advances in the performance of large language models (LLMs) have
sparked debate over whether, given sufficient training, high-level human
abilities emerge in such generic forms of artificial intelligence (AI). Despite
the exceptional performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks involving natural
language processing and reasoning, there has been sharp disagreement as to
whether their abilities extend to more creative human abilities. A core example
is the ability to interpret novel metaphors. Given the enormous and non curated
text corpora used to train LLMs, a serious obstacle to designing tests is the
requirement of finding novel yet high quality metaphors that are unlikely to
have been included in the training data. Here we assessed the ability of GPT4,
a state of the art large language model, to provide natural-language
interpretations of novel literary metaphors drawn from Serbian poetry and
translated into English. Despite exhibiting no signs of having been exposed to
these metaphors previously, the AI system consistently produced detailed and
incisive interpretations. Human judges, blind to the fact that an AI model was
involved, rated metaphor interpretations generated by GPT4 as superior to those
provided by a group of college students. In interpreting reversed metaphors,
GPT4, as well as humans, exhibited signs of sensitivity to the Gricean
cooperative principle. In addition, for several novel English poems GPT4
produced interpretations that were rated as excellent or good by a human
literary critic. These results indicate that LLMs such as GPT4 have acquired an
emergent ability to interpret complex metaphors, including those embedded in
novel poems.

近期，大型语言模型（LLM）的性能突破引发了学界争论：这类通用人工智能若经过充分训练，是否能够涌现出高阶人类能力。尽管LLM在自然语言处理和推理任务中表现卓越，但其能否展现更具创造性的隐喻理解能力仍存在尖锐分歧。本研究以塞尔维亚诗歌英译文本中的原创文学隐喻为测试材料，对前沿模型GPT-4进行考察。结果显示：1）该AI系统虽无接触过这些隐喻的迹象，却能持续生成细致深刻的解读；2）在盲测条件下，人类评委认为GPT-4的隐喻阐释优于大学生对照组；3）面对倒置隐喻时，GPT-4与人类同样表现出对格莱斯合作原则的敏感性；4）针对多首英文原创诗歌，GPT-4的解读获得专业文学评论家"优秀"或"良好"评级。这些证据表明，以GPT-4为代表的LLM已涌现出理解复杂隐喻（包括新诗中的隐喻）的突现能力。
