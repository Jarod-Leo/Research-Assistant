# AI with Emotions: Exploring Emotional Expressions in Large Language Models

原文摘要:
The human-level performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
tasks has raised expectations for the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to possess emotions someday. To explore the capability of current LLMs to
express emotions in their outputs, we conducted an experiment using several
LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Meta Llama3, and Cohere Command R+) to
role-play as agents answering questions with specified emotional states. We
defined the emotional states using Russell's Circumplex model, a
well-established framework that characterizes emotions along the
sleepy-activated (arousal) and pleasure-displeasure (valence) axes. We chose
this model for its simplicity, utilizing two continuous parameters, which
allows for better controllability in applications involving continuous changes
in emotional states. The responses generated were evaluated using a sentiment
analysis model, independent of the LLMs, trained on the GoEmotions dataset. The
evaluation showed that the emotional states of the generated answers were
consistent with the specifications, demonstrating the LLMs' capability for
emotional expression. This indicates the potential for LLM-based AI agents to
simulate emotions, opening up a wide range of applications for emotion-based
interactions, such as advisors or consultants who can provide advice or
opinions with a personal touch.

大型语言模型（LLM）在各类任务中展现的类人表现，使人们期待人工智能（AI）未来或能具备情感。为探究当前LLM在输出中表达情感的能力，我们设计了一项实验：让多个LLM（包括OpenAI GPT、Google Gemini、Meta Llama3和Cohere Command R+）扮演特定情感状态的代理回答问题。情感状态采用Russell的环状模型定义——这一成熟框架通过"睡眠-活跃"（唤醒度）和"愉悦-不悦"（效价）双轴描述情绪。选择该模型因其简洁性，仅需两个连续参数即可实现情感状态连续变化的精准控制。生成回答的情感评估由独立于LLM的情感分析模型完成，该模型基于GoEmotions数据集训练。评估结果显示生成答案的情感状态与设定高度吻合，证实了LLM的情感表达能力。这表明基于LLM的AI代理已具备情感模拟潜力，为情感化交互应用（如能提供个性化建议的顾问或咨询师）开辟了广阔前景。
