原文摘要:
In an era of widespread influence of Natural Language Processing (NLP), there
have been multiple research efforts to supplant traditional manual coding
techniques with automated systems capable of generating solutions autonomously.
With rapid research for code generation and a sole focus on large language
models, there emerges a need to compare and evaluate the performance of
transformer architectures based on several complexities of the model. This
paper introduces the concept of a "A Comparative Study on Code Generation with
Transformers," a model based on Transformer architecture, and NLP methodologies
to automatically generate C++ source code for different varieties of problems.
Here, a comparative study is performed to evaluate the robustness of
transformer-based models on the basis of their architecture complexities and
their capability to handle diverse problem sets, from basic arithmetic to
complex computations.

在自然语言处理（NLP）技术广泛影响的时代，已有众多研究致力于用能自主生成解决方案的自动化系统取代传统的手工编码方法。随着代码生成研究的快速推进及对大语言模型的单一关注，基于模型多种复杂度对Transformer架构性能进行比较和评估的需求日益凸显。本文提出"基于Transformer的代码生成对比研究"概念，通过构建基于Transformer架构的模型，运用NLP方法自动生成针对各类问题的C++源代码。研究通过对比实验评估不同复杂度架构的Transformer模型在代码生成任务中的鲁棒性，测试其处理从基础算术到复杂计算等多样化问题的能力。
