原文摘要:
Knowledge in materials science is widely dispersed across extensive
scientific literature, posing significant challenges for efficient discovery
and integration of new materials. Traditional methods, often reliant on costly
and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid
innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial
intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the
discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction,
and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article
introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural
language processing techniques, integrated with large language models to
extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research
into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG
categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and
Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing
data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG
not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces
reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only
streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more
sophisticated science knowledge graphs.

材料科学知识广泛分散于海量科学文献中，这为高效发现与整合新材料带来了巨大挑战。依赖高成本、耗时的传统实验方法进一步制约了快速创新进程。针对这些问题，人工智能与材料科学的融合为加速发现进程开辟了新途径，但同时也对信息标注精度、数据提取和可追溯性提出了更高要求。为此，本文提出材料科学知识图谱（MKG），通过融合先进自然语言处理技术与大语言模型，将十年间的高质量研究成果抽取并系统组织为包含162,605个节点和731,772条边的结构化三元组。该知识图谱围绕精心设计的本体框架，将信息分类为名称、分子式、应用场景等完整标签体系，显著提升了数据可用性与整合度。基于网络算法的实现不仅有效支持关联预测功能，更大幅降低了对传统实验方法的依赖。这种结构化研究方法不仅优化了材料科研流程，更为构建更复杂的科学知识图谱奠定了基础。
