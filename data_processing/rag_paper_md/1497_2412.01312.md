# Can ChatGPT pass a physics degree? Making a case for reformation of assessment of undergraduate degrees

原文摘要:
The emergence of conversational natural language processing models presents a
significant challenge for Higher Education. In this work, we use the entirety
of a UK physics undergraduate (BSc with Honours) degree including all
examinations and coursework to test if ChatGPT (GPT-4) can pass a degree. We
adopt a "maximal cheating" approach wherein we permit ourselves to modify
questions for clarity, split questions up into smaller sub-components, expand
on answers given - especially for long form written responses, obtaining
references, and use of advanced coaching, plug-ins and custom instructions to
optimize outputs. In general, there are only certain parts of the degree in
question where GPT-4 fails. Explicitly these include compulsory laboratory
elements, and the final project which is assessed by a viva. If these were no
issue, then GPT-4 would pass with a grade of an upper second class overall. In
general, coding tasks are performed exceptionally well, along with simple
single-step solution problems. Multiple step problems and longer prose are
generally poorer along with interdisciplinary problems. We strongly suggest
that there is now a necessity to urgently re-think and revise assessment
practice in physics - and other disciplines - due to the existence of AI such
as GPT-4. We recommend close scrutiny of assessment tasks: only invigilated
in-person examinations, vivas, laboratory skills testing (or "performances" in
other disciplines), and presentations are not vulnerable to GPT-4, and urge
consideration of how AI can be embedded within the disciplinary context.

会话式自然语言处理模型的出现对高等教育构成了重大挑战。本研究以英国物理学荣誉学士学位（BSc with Honours）的全部课程内容——包括所有考试与作业——为测试对象，检验ChatGPT（GPT-4）能否通过完整学位考核。我们采用"最大化作弊"策略：允许对题目进行清晰化修改、将问题拆分为更小子模块、扩展答案（尤其是长篇论述题）、获取参考文献，并运用高级提示技巧、插件及自定义指令优化输出结果。

总体而言，GPT-4仅在学位课程的特定环节存在明显缺陷，具体表现为必修实验课程和需要答辩评审的毕业设计。若排除这些环节，GPT-4能以二等一级（upper second class）的综合成绩通过考核。该模型在编码任务和简单单步求解问题上表现极为出色，但在多步骤问题、长篇论述及跨学科问题上普遍较弱。

我们强烈建议：鉴于GPT-4等人工智能的存在，物理学及其他学科亟需重新审视并彻底改革现有评估体系。经严密分析，仅以下评估形式能有效规避GPT-4的影响：现场监考笔试、口头答辩、实验技能测试（或其他学科的"实操展示"）以及学术汇报。我们敦促教育界深入探讨如何将人工智能有机融入学科教学评估体系。
