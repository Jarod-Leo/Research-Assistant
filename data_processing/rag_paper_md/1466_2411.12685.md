原文摘要:
We have come up with a research that hopes to provide a bridge between the
users of American Sign Language and the users of spoken language and Indian
Sign Language (ISL). The research enabled us to create a novel framework that
we have developed for Learner Systems. Leveraging art of Large models to create
key features including: - Real-time translation between these two sign
languages in an efficient manner. Making LLM's capability available for
seamless translations to ISL. Here is the full study showing its implementation
in this paper. The core of the system is a sophisticated pipeline that begins
with reclassification and recognition of ASL gestures based on a strong Random
Forest Classifier. By recognizing the ASL, it is translated into text which can
be more easily processed. Highly evolved natural language NLP (Natural Language
Processing) techniques come in handy as they play a role in our LLM integration
where you then use LLMs to be able to convert the ASL text to ISL which
provides you with the intent of sentence or phrase. The final step is to
synthesize the translated text back into ISL gestures, creating an end-to-end
translation experience using RIFE-Net. This framework is tasked with key
challenges such as automatically dealing with gesture variability and
overcoming the linguistic differences between ASL and ISL. By automating the
translation process, we hope to vastly improve accessibility for sign language
users. No longer will the communication gap between ASL and ISL create
barriers; this totally cool innovation aims to bring our communities closer
together. And we believe, with full confidence in our framework, that we're
able to apply the same principles across a wide variety of sign language
dialects.

我们提出了一项旨在搭建美国手语(ASL)使用者与口语使用者及印度手语(ISL)使用者之间沟通桥梁的研究。该研究使我们为学习系统开发出一个创新框架，通过运用大模型技术实现了以下核心功能：实时高效的双向手语互译，并利用大语言模型(LLM)实现向ISL的无缝翻译。本文完整展示了该系统的实现过程。

该系统的核心是一个精密的工作流程：首先基于强效随机森林分类器对ASL手势进行重新分类与识别，将识别出的ASL转化为更易处理的文本形式。随后采用先进的自然语言处理(NLP)技术，通过集成LLM将ASL文本转换为能准确传达语义的ISL表达。最终利用RIFE-Net将翻译文本重新合成为ISL手势，形成端到端的完整翻译闭环。

该框架重点攻克了手势自动变体处理及ASL与ISL语言差异等关键挑战。通过自动化翻译流程，我们有望显著提升手语使用者的沟通便利性。这项创新技术将彻底消除ASL与ISL之间的交流壁垒，使不同社群紧密相连。我们坚信，该框架的核心原理可进一步推广应用于多种手语方言的互译场景。
