# GPTZoo: A Large-scale Dataset of GPTs for the Research Community

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15630v1

原文摘要:
The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing, with GPTs, customized versions of ChatGPT
available on the GPT Store, emerging as a prominent technology for specific
domains and tasks. To support academic research on GPTs, we introduce GPTZoo, a
large-scale dataset comprising 730,420 GPT instances. Each instance includes
rich metadata with 21 attributes describing its characteristics, as well as
instructions, knowledge files, and third-party services utilized during its
development. GPTZoo aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive and
readily available resource to study the real-world applications, performance,
and potential of GPTs. To facilitate efficient retrieval and analysis of GPTs,
we also developed an automated command-line interface (CLI) that supports
keyword-based searching of the dataset. To promote open research and
innovation, the GPTZoo dataset will undergo continuous updates, and we are
granting researchers public access to GPTZoo and its associated tools.
