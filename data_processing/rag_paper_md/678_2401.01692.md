原文摘要:
Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves
to overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due
to differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from
external support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging
three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge
rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language
model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification
(cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from
student discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML
and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast
to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered
features by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three
approaches' performance for automated detection and support of students'
challenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that,
although LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to
issues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of
learning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity
evaluation, privacy and confabulation. We conclude the paper with a discussion
on additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible
and meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs.

有效的协作要求团队通过自我策略性调节来克服挑战。研究表明，由于成员对挑战认知的差异，团队可能难以实现有效调节，此时外部支持尤为重要。本研究探讨了三种自然语言处理模型在识别学生对话中的挑战及挑战维度（认知、元认知、情感和技术/其他类）方面的潜力：基于专家知识的规则模型、监督式机器学习模型和大语言模型（LLM）。结果显示，监督式机器学习与LLM方法在两项任务中表现优异，而规则方法的效能高度依赖专家设计的特征工程。本文深入分析了这三种方法在协作学习活动中自动检测和支持学生挑战时刻的适用性，指出尽管LLM具有诸多优势，但由于其可靠性不足、效度评估困难、隐私风险及虚构内容等问题，它无法成为学习社会共享调节检测与反馈的万能解决方案。最后，我们讨论了模型透明度等附加考量因素，探索如何利用LLM为学生和教育者提供可行且有意义的分析反馈。
