原文摘要:
In the field of natural language processing, the rapid development of large
language model (LLM) has attracted more and more attention. LLMs have shown a
high level of creativity in various tasks, but the methods for assessing such
creativity are inadequate. The assessment of LLM creativity needs to consider
differences from humans, requiring multi-dimensional measurement while
balancing accuracy and efficiency. This paper aims to establish an efficient
framework for assessing the level of creativity in LLMs. By adapting the
modified Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, the research evaluates the
creative performance of various LLMs across 7 tasks, emphasizing 4 criteria
including Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. In this context,
we develop a comprehensive dataset of 700 questions for testing and an
LLM-based evaluation method. In addition, this study presents a novel analysis
of LLMs' responses to diverse prompts and role-play situations. We found that
the creativity of LLMs primarily falls short in originality, while excelling in
elaboration. Besides, the use of prompts and the role-play settings of the
model significantly influence creativity. Additionally, the experimental
results also indicate that collaboration among multiple LLMs can enhance
originality. Notably, our findings reveal a consensus between human evaluations
and LLMs regarding the personality traits that influence creativity. The
findings underscore the significant impact of LLM design on creativity and
bridges artificial intelligence and human creativity, offering insights into
LLMs' creativity and potential applications.

在自然语言处理领域，大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展正引发越来越多的关注。尽管LLM在各类任务中展现出高度的创造性，但针对其创造力的评估方法仍显不足。LLM创造力评估需兼顾与人类差异化的特性，既要实现多维度测量，又需平衡准确性与效率。本文旨在建立一套高效评估LLM创造力水平的框架，通过改良版托伦斯创造性思维测试（TTCT），从流畅性、灵活性、原创性和精细性四个维度，对多种LLM在7项任务中的创造性表现进行系统评估。研究构建了包含700道测试题的完整数据集，并开发了基于LLM的自动化评估方法。实验特别考察了提示词工程与角色扮演情境对模型创造力的影响机制，发现LLM的创造力短板主要集中于原创性维度，而在精细性方面表现突出；同时提示策略与角色设定会显著改变创造力表现特征。此外，实验结果还表明多模型协同工作能有效提升原创性产出。值得注意的是，本研究首次揭示了人类评估者与LLM在影响创造力的人格特质认知上存在共识。这些发现不仅为理解LLM创造力机制提供了新视角，也为人工智能与人类创造力的交叉研究搭建了桥梁。
