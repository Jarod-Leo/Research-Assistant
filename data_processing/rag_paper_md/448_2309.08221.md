原文摘要:
Code review is an essential activity for ensuring the quality and
maintainability of software projects. However, it is a time-consuming and often
error-prone task that can significantly impact the development process.
Recently, ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model, has demonstrated impressive
performance in various natural language processing tasks, suggesting its
potential to automate code review processes. However, it is still unclear how
well ChatGPT performs in code review tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, we
conduct the first empirical study to understand the capabilities of ChatGPT in
code review tasks, specifically focusing on automated code refinement based on
given code reviews. To conduct the study, we select the existing benchmark
CodeReview and construct a new code review dataset with high quality. We use
CodeReviewer, a state-of-the-art code review tool, as a baseline for comparison
with ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT outperforms CodeReviewer in code
refinement tasks. Specifically, our results show that ChatGPT achieves higher
EM and BLEU scores of 22.78 and 76.44 respectively, while the state-of-the-art
method achieves only 15.50 and 62.88 on a high-quality code review dataset. We
further identify the root causes for ChatGPT's underperformance and propose
several strategies to mitigate these challenges. Our study provides insights
into the potential of ChatGPT in automating the code review process, and
highlights the potential research directions.

代码审查是保障软件项目质量与可维护性的关键活动，但其耗时且易错的特点常对开发流程造成显著影响。近期，前沿语言模型ChatGPT在多项自然语言处理任务中展现出卓越性能，预示着其自动化代码审查流程的潜力。然而，该模型在代码审查任务中的实际表现仍不明确。为此，本文首次开展实证研究，以探究ChatGPT在基于给定审查意见的自动化代码优化任务中的能力。研究过程中，我们选取现有基准数据集CodeReview并构建了高质量的新代码审查数据集，同时以当前最先进的代码审查工具CodeReviewer作为基线进行对比。实验结果表明：在高质量代码审查数据集上，ChatGPT以22.78的EM分数和76.44的BLEU分数显著优于仅获得15.50和62.88分的现有最优方法。我们进一步分析了ChatGPT的不足根源，并提出多项改进策略。本研究不仅揭示了ChatGPT在代码审查自动化领域的应用前景，更为未来研究方向提供了重要启示。
