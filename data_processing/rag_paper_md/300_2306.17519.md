原文摘要:
Relation extraction (RE) is a crucial task in natural language processing
(NLP) that aims to identify and classify relationships between entities
mentioned in text. In the financial domain, relation extraction plays a vital
role in extracting valuable information from financial documents, such as news
articles, earnings reports, and company filings. This paper describes our
solution to relation extraction on one such dataset REFinD. The dataset was
released along with shared task as a part of the Fourth Workshop on Knowledge
Discovery from Unstructured Data in Financial Services, co-located with SIGIR
2023. In this paper, we employed OpenAI models under the framework of
in-context learning (ICL). We utilized two retrieval strategies to find top K
relevant in-context learning demonstrations / examples from training data for a
given test example. The first retrieval mechanism, we employed, is a
learning-free dense retriever and the other system is a learning-based
retriever. We were able to achieve 3rd rank overall. Our best F1-score is
0.718.

关系抽取（Relation Extraction, RE）是自然语言处理（NLP）中的核心任务，旨在识别并分类文本中提及的实体间关系。在金融领域，该技术对从新闻稿件、财报文件及公司公告等金融文档中提取关键信息具有重要作用。本文阐述了我们在金融关系抽取数据集REFinD上的解决方案。该数据集由第四届金融服务非结构化数据知识发现研讨会（与SIGIR 2023联合举办）作为共享任务发布。本研究采用上下文学习（In-Context Learning, ICL）框架下的OpenAI模型，通过两种检索策略从训练数据中为测试样本筛选Top K相关示例：第一种是无监督稠密检索器，第二种是基于学习的检索系统。我们的方法最终取得总排名第三的成绩，最佳F1值达到0.718。
