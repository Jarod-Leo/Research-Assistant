原文摘要:
Multi-aspect controllable text generation aims to control text generation in
attributes from multiple aspects, making it a complex but powerful task in
natural language processing. Supervised fine-tuning methods are often employed
for this task due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they still
have some limitations: low rank adaptation (LoRA) only fine-tunes a few
parameters and has suboptimal control effects, while full fine-tuning (FFT)
requires significant computational resources and is susceptible to overfitting,
particularly when data is limited. Moreover, existing works typically train
multi-aspect controllable text generation models using only single-aspect
annotated data, which results in discrepancies in data distribution; at the
same time, accurately generating text with specific attributes is a challenge
that requires strong attribute-aware capabilities. To address these
limitations, we propose a lightweight, adaptive and attribute-aware framework
for multi-aspect controllable text generation. Our framework can dynamically
adjust model parameters according to different aspects of data to achieve
controllable text generation, aiming to optimize performance across multiple
aspects. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms other strong
baselines, achieves state-of-the-art performance, adapts well to data
discrepancies, and is more accurate in attribute perception.

多维度可控文本生成旨在从多个属性维度控制文本生成过程，使其成为自然语言处理中一项复杂而强大的任务。该任务通常采用监督微调方法，因其简单高效而被广泛使用。然而现有方法仍存在局限：低秩自适应（LoRA）仅微调少量参数导致控制效果欠佳，而全参数微调（FFT）需要大量计算资源且易出现过拟合，在数据有限时尤为明显。此外，现有研究通常仅使用单维度标注数据训练多维度可控文本生成模型，这会导致数据分布偏差；同时，精确生成具有特定属性的文本需要强大的属性感知能力，这对模型提出了挑战。为解决这些局限，我们提出了一种轻量级、自适应且具备属性感知能力的多维度可控文本生成框架。该框架能根据数据的不同维度动态调整模型参数以实现可控文本生成，旨在优化多维度性能表现。实验结果表明，我们的框架性能优于其他强基线模型，达到当前最优水平，能良好适应数据分布偏差，并展现出更精准的属性感知能力。
