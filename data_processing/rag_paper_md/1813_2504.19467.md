# BRIDGE: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Understanding Real-world Clinical Practice Text

原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and
are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace.
However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most
existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived
text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record
(EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting
their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we
present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks
sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We
systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1,
GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total
of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation
across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical
specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve
performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs
based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose
models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational
resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs
in real-world clinical text understanding.

大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗领域展现出巨大潜力且发展迅猛，新模型发布速度持续加快。然而当前针对临床场景的LLM评估仍存在局限：多数基准测试依赖医学考试式题目或PubMed衍生文本，未能体现真实电子健康记录（EHR）数据的复杂性；另一些则过度聚焦特定应用场景，限制了临床泛化能力。为此，我们推出BRIDGE——一个涵盖9种语言、包含87项真实临床数据任务的综合性多语言基准测试。通过系统评估52个前沿LLM（含DeepSeek-R1、GPT-4o、Gemini和Llama 4）在不同推理策略下的表现（总计13,572次实验），发现模型性能在参数量级、语言类型、自然语言处理任务及临床专科间存在显著差异。值得注意的是，开源LLM可达到与专有模型相当的效能，而基于旧架构的医学微调模型往往逊色于更新的通用模型。BRIDGE及其对应排行榜为真实临床文本理解领域的LLM开发与评估提供了基础性资源和独特参照系。
