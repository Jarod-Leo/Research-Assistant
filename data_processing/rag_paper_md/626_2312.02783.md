原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT4 and LLaMA, are creating
significant advancements in natural language processing, due to their strong
text encoding/decoding ability and newly found emergent capability (e.g.,
reasoning). While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are
many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure
information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce
networks) or scenarios where graph data is paired with rich textual information
(e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have shown their
pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can
be generalized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we
provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large
language models on graphs. We first summarize potential scenarios of adopting
LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs, text-attributed
graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed techniques for
utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor, LLM as Encoder, and LLM
as Aligner, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools
of models. Furthermore, we discuss the real-world applications of such methods
and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude
with potential future research directions in this fast-growing field. The

诸如GPT4和LLaMA之类的大型语言模型（LLMs）凭借其强大的文本编码/解码能力及新涌现的推理等特性，正在推动自然语言处理领域的重大进步。尽管LLMs主要设计用于处理纯文本，但在现实场景中，文本数据常与丰富的图结构信息相关联（如学术网络、电商网络），或图数据本身附带大量文本描述（如分子结构配文说明）。此外，尽管LLMs已展现出基于纯文本的推理能力，这种能力能否推广至图数据（即基于图的推理）仍有待探索。本文系统梳理了图数据上应用大型语言模型的相关场景与技术，将LLMs在图上的应用场景归纳为三类：纯图结构、文本属性图及文本配对图，详细探讨了LLM作为预测器、编码器和对齐器的技术方案，并对比了不同技术路线的优劣。进一步分析了这些方法在实际应用中的表现，汇总了开源代码与基准数据集。最后展望了这一快速发展领域的未来研究方向。相关资源详见https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Awesome-Language-Model-on-Graphs。
