# Figuratively Speaking: Authorship Attribution via Multi-Task Figurative Language Modeling

原文摘要:
The identification of Figurative Language (FL) features in text is crucial
for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, where understanding of the
author's intended meaning and its nuances is key for successful communication.
At the same time, the use of a specific blend of various FL forms most
accurately reflects a writer's style, rather than the use of any single
construct, such as just metaphors or irony. Thus, we postulate that FL features
could play an important role in Authorship Attribution (AA) tasks. We believe
that our is the first computational study of AA based on FL use. Accordingly,
we propose a Multi-task Figurative Language Model (MFLM) that learns to detect
multiple FL features in text at once. We demonstrate, through detailed
evaluation across multiple test sets, that the our model tends to perform
equally or outperform specialized binary models in FL detection. Subsequently,
we evaluate the predictive capability of joint FL features towards the AA task
on three datasets, observing improved AA performance through the integration of
MFLM embeddings.

文本中修辞语言（FL）特征的识别对于多种自然语言处理（NLP）任务至关重要，因为理解作者的意图及其细微差别是成功沟通的关键。与此同时，特定组合的多种修辞形式最能准确反映作者的写作风格，而非单一结构（如仅隐喻或反讽）的使用。因此，我们提出假设：FL特征在作者归属（AA）任务中可能发挥重要作用。据我们所知，这是首个基于FL使用的AA计算研究。为此，我们提出了一个多任务修辞语言模型（MFLM），该模型能够同时学习检测文本中的多种FL特征。通过在多个测试集上的详细评估，我们证明该模型在FL检测中表现与专用二元模型相当或更优。随后，我们在三个数据集上评估了联合FL特征对AA任务的预测能力，发现通过整合MFLM嵌入可提升AA性能。
