原文摘要:
ChatGPT sets a new record with the fastest-growing user base, as a chatbot
powered by a large language model (LLM). While it demonstrates state-of-the-art
capabilities in a variety of language-generation tasks, it also raises
widespread public concerns regarding its societal impact. In this paper, we
investigated public attitudes towards ChatGPT by applying natural language
processing techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to Twitter
data from December 5, 2022 to June 10, 2023. Our sentiment analysis result
indicates that the overall sentiment was largely neutral to positive, and
negative sentiments were decreasing over time. Our topic model reveals that the
most popular topics discussed were Education, Bard, Search Engines, OpenAI,
Marketing, and Cybersecurity, but the ranking varies by month. We also analyzed
the occupations of Twitter users and found that those with occupations in arts
and entertainment tweeted aboutChatGPT most frequently. Additionally, people
tended to tweet about topics relevant to their occupation. For instance,
Cybersecurity is the most discussed topic among those with occupations related
to computer and math, and Education is the most discussed topic among those in
academic and research. Overall, our exploratory study provides insights into
the public perception of ChatGPT, which could be valuable to both the general
public and developers of this technology.

ChatGPT作为大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的聊天机器人，以史上最快用户增速创下新纪录。尽管该技术在各类语言生成任务中展现出尖端能力，却也引发了公众对其社会影响的广泛担忧。本文通过应用情感分析和主题建模等自然语言处理技术，对2022年12月5日至2023年6月10日的推特数据进行分析，探究了公众对ChatGPT的态度。情感分析结果显示，整体情绪以中性至积极为主，且负面情绪随时间推移呈下降趋势。主题模型显示最受关注的讨论主题依次为教育、Bard、搜索引擎、OpenAI、营销和网络安全，但月度排名存在波动。通过分析用户职业特征发现，艺术娱乐从业者发布相关推文最为频繁，且人们倾向于讨论与自身职业相关的主题。例如计算机数学领域从业者最常讨论网络安全主题，而学术研究人员则最关注教育话题。这项探索性研究揭示了公众对ChatGPT的认知图景，其发现对普通用户和技术开发者均具有重要参考价值。
