原文摘要:
Stance detection has emerged as a popular task in natural language processing
research, enabled largely by the abundance of target-specific social media
data. While there has been considerable research on the development of stance
detection models, datasets, and application, we highlight important gaps
pertaining to (i) a lack of theoretical conceptualization of stance, and (ii)
the treatment of stance at an individual- or user-level, as opposed to
message-level. In this paper, we first review the interdisciplinary origins of
stance as an individual-level construct to highlight relevant attributes (e.g.,
psychological features) that might be useful to incorporate in stance detection
models. Further, we argue that recent pre-trained and large language models
(LLMs) might offer a way to flexibly infer such user-level attributes and/or
incorporate them in modelling stance. To better illustrate this, we briefly
review and synthesize the emerging corpus of studies on using LLMs for
inferring stance, and specifically on incorporating user attributes in such
tasks. We conclude by proposing a four-point agenda for pursuing stance
detection research that is theoretically informed, inclusive, and practically
impactful.

立场检测已成为自然语言处理研究中的热门任务，这主要得益于目标明确的社交媒体数据的大量涌现。尽管在立场检测模型、数据集及应用开发方面已有大量研究，我们仍需关注两个重要空白领域：(i) 缺乏对立场概念的理论化界定；(ii) 现有研究多聚焦于消息层面的立场分析，而非个体用户层面的立场特征。本文首先追溯了立场作为个体层面构念的跨学科理论渊源，着重探讨了可能有助于改进立场检测模型的相关属性（如心理特征）。进一步提出，当前预训练大语言模型（LLMs）或能提供灵活推断此类用户层面属性并将其融入立场建模的新途径。为具体说明这一观点，我们系统梳理了LLMs在立场推断领域的新兴研究成果，特别关注了用户属性在此类任务中的整合应用研究。最后提出四点研究议程，旨在推动立场检测研究向理论化、包容性和实践影响力方向发展。
