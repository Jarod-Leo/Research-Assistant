# XTRUST: On the Multilingual Trustworthiness of Large Language Models

原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, capturing the attention of
both practitioners and the broader public. A key question that now preoccupies
the AI community concerns the capabilities and limitations of these models,
with trustworthiness emerging as a central issue, particularly as LLMs are
increasingly applied in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance, where
errors can have serious consequences. However, most previous studies on the
trustworthiness of LLMs have been limited to a single language, typically the
predominant one in the dataset, such as English. In response to the growing
global deployment of LLMs, we introduce XTRUST, the first comprehensive
multilingual trustworthiness benchmark. XTRUST encompasses a diverse range of
topics, including illegal activities, hallucination, out-of-distribution (OOD)
robustness, physical and mental health, toxicity, fairness, misinformation,
privacy, and machine ethics, across 10 different languages. Using XTRUST, we
conduct an empirical evaluation of the multilingual trustworthiness of five
widely used LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across
languages and tasks. Our results indicate that many LLMs struggle with certain
low-resource languages, such as Arabic and Russian, highlighting the
considerable room for improvement in the multilingual trustworthiness of
current language models. The code is available at

大型语言模型（LLMs）在一系列自然语言处理（NLP）任务中展现出卓越能力，引发了从业者和公众的广泛关注。当前AI领域的核心问题聚焦于这些模型的能力边界与局限性，其中可信度成为关键议题——尤其在医疗、金融等容错成本极高的敏感领域，LLMs的部署日益增多。然而既有研究多局限于单一语言（通常是数据集中的主导语言如英语），难以满足LLMs全球化应用的需求。为此，我们推出首个综合性多语言可信度基准评估框架XTRUST，涵盖非法活动、幻觉生成、分布外（OOD）鲁棒性、身心健康、毒性内容、公平性、虚假信息、隐私保护及机器伦理等九大维度，覆盖10种语言。基于该框架，我们对五种主流LLMs进行了多语言可信度实证评估，深入解析其跨语言、跨任务表现。实验结果表明，现有模型在阿拉伯语、俄语等低资源语言上表现欠佳，凸显当前多语言可信度仍有显著提升空间。代码已开源：https://github.com/LluckyYH/XTRUST。
