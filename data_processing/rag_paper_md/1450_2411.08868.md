# CamemBERT 2.0: A Smarter French Language Model Aged to Perfection

原文摘要:
French language models, such as CamemBERT, have been widely adopted across
industries for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, with models like
CamemBERT seeing over 4 million downloads per month. However, these models face
challenges due to temporal concept drift, where outdated training data leads to
a decline in performance, especially when encountering new topics and
terminology. This issue emphasizes the need for updated models that reflect
current linguistic trends. In this paper, we introduce two new versions of the
CamemBERT base model-CamemBERTav2 and CamemBERTv2-designed to address these
challenges. CamemBERTav2 is based on the DeBERTaV3 architecture and makes use
of the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) objective for better contextual
understanding, while CamemBERTv2 is built on RoBERTa, which uses the Masked
Language Modeling (MLM) objective. Both models are trained on a significantly
larger and more recent dataset with longer context length and an updated
tokenizer that enhances tokenization performance for French. We evaluate the
performance of these models on both general-domain NLP tasks and
domain-specific applications, such as medical field tasks, demonstrating their
versatility and effectiveness across a range of use cases. Our results show
that these updated models vastly outperform their predecessors, making them
valuable tools for modern NLP systems. All our new models, as well as
intermediate checkpoints, are made openly available on Huggingface.

法语语言模型（如CamemBERT）已在各行业自然语言处理任务中得到广泛应用，其中CamemBERT模型的月下载量超过400万次。然而这些模型面临着时间概念漂移的挑战——陈旧的训练数据会导致性能下降，尤其当涉及新话题和术语时更为明显。这一现象凸显了反映当前语言趋势的模型更新的必要性。本文推出了CamemBERT基础模型的两个新版本：采用DeBERTaV3架构并利用替换标记检测（RTD）目标以增强上下文理解的CamemBERTav2，以及基于RoBERTa框架、使用掩码语言建模（MLM）目标的CamemBERTv2。两个模型均在显著扩容且时效性更强的数据集上完成训练，具有更长的上下文处理能力，并配备了提升法语分词性能的新版分词器。我们通过在通用领域NLP任务（如医疗领域应用）和垂直领域任务上的测试，验证了模型在多场景下的适应性与有效性。实验结果表明，这些升级版模型性能远超前代产品，已成为现代NLP系统的有力工具。所有新模型及中间检查点均已开源发布于Huggingface平台。
