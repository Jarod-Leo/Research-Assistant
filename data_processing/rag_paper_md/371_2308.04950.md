原文摘要:
Fake news is fake material in a news media format but is not processed
properly by news agencies. The fake material can provoke or defame significant
entities or individuals or potentially even for the personal interests of the
creators, causing problems for society. Distinguishing fake news and real news
is challenging due to limited of domain knowledge and time constraints.
According to the survey, the top three areas most exposed to hoaxes and
misinformation by residents are in Banten, DKI Jakarta and West Java. The model
of transformers is referring to an approach in the field of artificial
intelligence (AI) in natural language processing utilizing the deep learning
architectures. Transformers exercise a powerful attention mechanism to process
text in parallel and produce rich and contextual word representations. A
previous study indicates a superior performance of a transformer model known as
BERT over and above non transformer approach. However, some studies suggest the
performance can be improved with the use of improved BERT models known as
ALBERT and RoBERTa. However, the modified BERT models are not well explored for
detecting fake news in Bahasa Indonesia. In this research, we explore those
transformer models and found that ALBERT outperformed other models with 87.6%
accuracy, 86.9% precision, 86.9% F1-score, and 174.5 run-time (s/epoch)
respectively. Source code available at:

假新闻是以新闻媒体形式呈现但未经正规新闻机构处理的虚假内容。这类虚假材料可能出于抹黑重要机构或个人，甚至创作者的个人利益，从而引发社会问题。由于领域知识有限和时间压力，区分真假新闻具有挑战性。调查显示，印尼居民遭遇虚假信息最多的前三大地区分别是万丹省、雅加达首都特区和西爪哇省。

Transformer模型是指人工智能领域在自然语言处理中采用深度学习架构的一种方法。该模型通过强大的注意力机制并行处理文本，生成丰富且具有上下文关联的词汇表征。先前研究表明，名为BERT的Transformer模型性能优于非Transformer方法。但另有研究指出，使用改进版BERT模型（如ALBERT和RoBERTa）可进一步提升性能。然而这些改进模型在印尼语假新闻检测领域的应用尚未得到充分探索。

本研究对这些Transformer模型进行测试，发现ALBERT模型以87.6%准确率、86.9%精确率、86.9% F1分数和174.5秒/周期的运行时间优于其他模型。源代码详见：https://github.com/Shafna81/fakenewsdetection.git
