原文摘要:
Recent developments in the field of Natural Language Processing, especially
language models such as the transformer have brought state-of-the-art results
in language understanding and language generation. In this work, we investigate
the use of the transformer model for radiology report generation from chest
X-rays. We also highlight limitations in evaluating radiology report generation
using only the standard language generation metrics. We then applied a
transformer based radiology report generation architecture, and also compare
the performance of a transformer based decoder with the recurrence based
decoder. Experiments were performed using the IU-CXR dataset, showing superior
results to its LSTM counterpart and being significantly faster. Finally, we
identify the need of evaluating radiology report generation system using both
language generation metrics and classification metrics, which helps to provide
robust measure of generated reports in terms of their coherence and diagnostic
value.

自然语言处理领域的最新进展，尤其是以Transformer为代表的语言模型，在语言理解与生成任务中取得了突破性成果。本研究探讨了基于Transformer的模型在胸部X光影像生成放射学报告中的应用。我们指出仅采用标准语言生成指标评估放射学报告生成系统存在的局限性，进而构建了基于Transformer的放射学报告生成架构，并将其解码器性能与基于循环神经网络的解码器进行对比。实验在IU-CXR数据集上展开，结果表明Transformer模型不仅显著优于LSTM模型，且具有更快的处理速度。最后我们提出需要结合语言生成指标与分类指标进行双重评估，这种综合评估方法能更全面地衡量生成报告的连贯性及诊断价值。
