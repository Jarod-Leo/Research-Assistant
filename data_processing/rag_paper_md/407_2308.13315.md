原文摘要:
Recent progress in deep learning and natural language processing has given
rise to powerful models that are primarily trained on a cloze-like task and
show some evidence of having access to substantial linguistic information,
including some constructional knowledge. This groundbreaking discovery presents
an exciting opportunity for a synergistic relationship between computational
methods and Construction Grammar research. In this chapter, we explore three
distinct approaches to the interplay between computational methods and
Construction Grammar: (i) computational methods for text analysis, (ii)
computational Construction Grammar, and (iii) deep learning models, with a
particular focus on language models. We touch upon the first two approaches as
a contextual foundation for the use of computational methods before providing
an accessible, yet comprehensive overview of deep learning models, which also
addresses reservations construction grammarians may have. Additionally, we
delve into experiments that explore the emergence of constructionally relevant
information within these models while also examining the aspects of
Construction Grammar that may pose challenges for these models. This chapter
aims to foster collaboration between researchers in the fields of natural
language processing and Construction Grammar. By doing so, we hope to pave the
way for new insights and advancements in both these fields.

深度学习与自然语言处理领域的最新进展催生出一类基于完形填空任务训练的强大模型，这些模型展现出对包括构式知识在内的丰富语言信息的处理能力。这一突破性发现为计算方法与构式语法研究之间的协同合作提供了崭新机遇。本章系统探讨了计算方法与构式语法互动的三种路径：（1）面向文本分析的计算方法，（2）计算构式语法，以及（3）以语言模型为核心的深度学习模型。在深入剖析深度学习模型之前，我们首先以前两种方法作为运用计算方法的语境基础，继而以通俗而全面的视角阐释深度学习模型，同时回应构式语法学者可能存在的疑虑。我们进一步通过实验探究这些模型中构式相关信息的涌现机制，并分析构式语法理论中可能对模型构成挑战的维度。本章旨在促进自然语言处理与构式语法领域研究者的深度对话，从而为两个领域的知识创新与方法突破开辟新路径。
