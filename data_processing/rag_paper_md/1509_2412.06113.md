原文摘要:
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
natural language processing, enabling applications in diverse domains such as
healthcare, finance and education. However, the growing reliance on extensive
data for training and inference has raised significant privacy concerns,
ranging from data leakage to adversarial attacks. This survey comprehensively
explores the landscape of privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored for LLMs,
including differential privacy, federated learning, cryptographic protocols,
and trusted execution environments. We examine their efficacy in addressing key
privacy challenges, such as membership inference and model inversion attacks,
while balancing trade-offs between privacy and model utility. Furthermore, we
analyze privacy-preserving applications of LLMs in privacy-sensitive domains,
highlighting successful implementations and inherent limitations. Finally, this
survey identifies emerging research directions, emphasizing the need for novel
frameworks that integrate privacy by design into the lifecycle of LLMs. By
synthesizing state-of-the-art approaches and future trends, this paper provides
a foundation for developing robust, privacy-preserving large language models
that safeguard sensitive information without compromising performance.
