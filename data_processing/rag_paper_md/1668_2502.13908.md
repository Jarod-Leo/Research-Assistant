原文摘要:
Using Large Language Models (LLMs) for relevance assessments offers promising
opportunities to improve Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language
Processing (NLP), and related fields. Indeed, LLMs hold the promise of allowing
IR experimenters to build evaluation collections with a fraction of the manual
human labor currently required. This could help with fresh topics on which
there is still limited knowledge and could mitigate the challenges of
evaluating ranking systems in low-resource scenarios, where it is challenging
to find human annotators. Given the fast-paced recent developments in the
domain, many questions concerning LLMs as assessors are yet to be answered.
Among the aspects that require further investigation, we can list the impact of
various components in a relevance judgment generation pipeline, such as the
prompt used or the LLM chosen.
  This paper benchmarks and reports on the results of a large-scale automatic
relevance judgment evaluation, the LLMJudge challenge at SIGIR 2024, where
different relevance assessment approaches were proposed. In detail, we release
and benchmark 42 LLM-generated labels of the TREC 2023 Deep Learning track
relevance judgments produced by eight international teams who participated in
the challenge. Given their diverse nature, these automatically generated
relevance judgments can help the community not only investigate systematic
biases caused by LLMs but also explore the effectiveness of ensemble models,
analyze the trade-offs between different models and human assessors, and
advance methodologies for improving automated evaluation techniques. The

利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行相关性评估，为改进信息检索（IR）、自然语言处理（NLP）及相关领域提供了广阔前景。LLMs有望显著减少当前构建评估数据集所需的人工工作量，这对于知识尚不完善的新兴主题尤为重要，并能缓解资源匮乏场景下寻找人工标注者评估排序系统的难题。然而，该领域发展迅猛，关于LLMs作为评估者的诸多问题仍有待探索，包括提示词设计、模型选择等影响相关性判断生成流程的关键因素。

本文基于SIGIR 2024大会LLMJudge挑战赛的大规模自动相关性评估结果展开基准研究。我们公开并分析了八支国际团队针对TREC 2023深度学习赛道生成的42组LLM标注结果。这些多元化自动标注不仅有助于研究LLM系统性偏差，还可推动以下研究方向：集成模型效果验证、不同模型与人工评估者的权衡分析，以及自动化评估技术的优化方法创新。相关资源详见：https://llm4eval.github.io/LLMJudge-benchmark/
