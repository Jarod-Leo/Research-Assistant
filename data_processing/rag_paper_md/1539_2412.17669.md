原文摘要:
Broca's aphasia is a type of aphasia characterized by non-fluent, effortful
and fragmented speech production with relatively good comprehension. Since
traditional aphasia treatment methods are often time-consuming,
labour-intensive, and do not reflect real-world conversations, applying natural
language processing based approaches such as Large Language Models (LLMs) could
potentially contribute to improving existing treatment approaches. To address
this issue, we explore the use of sequence-to-sequence LLMs for completing
fragmented Broca's aphasic sentences. We first generate synthetic Broca's
aphasic data using a rule-based system designed to mirror the linguistic
characteristics of Broca's aphasic speech. Using this synthetic data, we then
fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs on the task of completing fragmented sentences.
We evaluate our fine-tuned models on both synthetic and authentic Broca's
aphasic data. We demonstrate LLMs' capability for reconstructing fragmented
sentences, with the models showing improved performance with longer input
utterances. Our result highlights the LLMs' potential in advancing
communication aids for individuals with Broca's aphasia and possibly other
clinical populations.

布罗卡失语症是一种以非流畅、费力且断续的言语产出为特征，同时理解能力相对保留的语言障碍。由于传统失语症治疗方法通常耗时耗力且难以模拟真实对话场景，应用基于自然语言处理技术（如大语言模型）有望优化现有治疗方案。为此，我们探索了序列到序列大语言模型在补全布罗卡失语症患者断续语句中的应用。首先通过基于规则的系统生成合成数据，模拟布罗卡失语症的语言特征；随后利用该数据对四个预训练大语言模型进行断续句补全任务的微调。我们在合成数据与真实临床数据上评估微调模型效果，证实大语言模型能够有效重构断续语句，且输入语句越长模型表现越佳。这一成果揭示了大语言模型在开发布罗卡失语症及其他临床人群沟通辅助工具方面的应用潜力。
