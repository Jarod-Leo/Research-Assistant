原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
general-purpose natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs are still
facing challenges when applied to domain-specific areas like
telecommunications, which demands specialized expertise and adaptability to
evolving standards. This paper presents a novel framework that combines
knowledge graph (KG) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to
enhance LLM performance in the telecom domain. The framework leverages a KG to
capture structured, domain-specific information about network protocols,
standards, and other telecom-related entities, comprehensively representing
their relationships. By integrating KG with RAG, LLMs can dynamically access
and utilize the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge during response
generation. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between structured knowledge
representation and the generative capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing
accuracy, adaptability, and domain-specific comprehension. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the KG-RAG framework in addressing complex
technical queries with precision. The proposed KG-RAG model attained an
accuracy of 88% for question answering tasks on a frequently used
telecom-specific dataset, compared to 82% for the RAG-only and 48% for the
LLM-only approaches.

大型语言模型（LLM）在通用自然语言处理任务中取得了显著进展，但在电信等专业领域应用时仍面临挑战。这些领域不仅需要专业知识，还需适应不断更新的技术标准。本文提出了一种创新框架，通过结合知识图谱（KG）与检索增强生成（RAG）技术来提升LLM在电信领域的表现。该框架利用KG结构化地存储网络协议、标准等电信实体的领域知识，完整呈现其关联关系。通过KG与RAG的协同机制，LLM能在生成响应时动态获取并利用最相关、最新的专业知识。这种混合方法弥合了结构化知识表示与LLM生成能力之间的鸿沟，显著提升了准确性、适应性和领域理解力。实验结果表明，KG-RAG框架能精准处理复杂技术查询：在常用电信数据集问答任务中，KG-RAG模型准确率达88%，显著优于纯RAG（82%）和纯LLM（48%）方法。
