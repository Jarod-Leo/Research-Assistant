# Transformer-Based Approaches for Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition: Opportunities and Challenges

原文摘要:
Transformers have excelled in natural language processing and computer
vision, paving their way to sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Previous studies show that transformers outperform their counterparts
exclusively when they harness abundant data or employ compute-intensive
optimization algorithms. However, neither of these scenarios is viable in
sensor-based HAR due to the scarcity of data in this field and the frequent
need to perform training and inference on resource-constrained devices. Our
extensive investigation into various implementations of transformer-based
versus non-transformer-based HAR using wearable sensors, encompassing more than
500 experiments, corroborates these concerns. We observe that transformer-based
solutions pose higher computational demands, consistently yield inferior
performance, and experience significant performance degradation when quantized
to accommodate resource-constrained devices. Additionally, transformers
demonstrate lower robustness to adversarial attacks, posing a potential threat
to user trust in HAR.

Transformer模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域表现卓越，进而被引入基于传感器的人类活动识别（HAR）研究。已有研究表明，Transformer仅在数据充足或采用计算密集型优化算法时才能超越其他模型。然而这两种条件在基于传感器的HAR领域均难以实现——该领域普遍存在数据匮乏问题，且经常需要在资源受限设备上进行训练和推理。我们通过对可穿戴设备场景下500余组实验的全面对比分析（涵盖各类Transformer与非Transformer的HAR实现方案），验证了这些担忧：基于Transformer的方案存在计算需求更高、性能持续偏低、量化适配资源受限设备时性能显著下降等问题。此外，Transformer对对抗攻击的鲁棒性较弱，可能危及用户对HAR系统的信任。
