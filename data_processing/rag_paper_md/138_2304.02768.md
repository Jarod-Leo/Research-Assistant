# Application of Transformers based methods in Electronic Medical Records: A Systematic Literature Review

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02768v1

原文摘要:
The combined growth of available data and their unstructured nature has
received increased interest in natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
make value of these data assets since this format is not suitable for
statistical analysis. This work presents a systematic literature review of
state-of-the-art advances using transformer-based methods on electronic medical
records (EMRs) in different NLP tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is unique in providing a comprehensive review of research on transformer-based
methods for NLP applied to the EMR field. In the initial query, 99 articles
were selected from three public databases and filtered into 65 articles for
detailed analysis. The papers were analyzed with respect to the business
problem, NLP task, models and techniques, availability of datasets,
reproducibility of modeling, language, and exchange format. The paper presents
some limitations of current research and some recommendations for further
research.

随着可用数据的不断增长及其非结构化特性的结合，自然语言处理（NLP）技术因能有效挖掘这类不适合统计分析的数据资产价值而受到广泛关注。本文系统综述了基于Transformer的先进方法在电子病历（EMRs）各类NLP任务中的应用研究进展。据我们所知，这是首篇全面梳理Transformer方法在EMR领域NLP应用的综述性研究。通过初始检索从三大公共数据库获取99篇文献，经筛选后对65篇文献展开深入分析。研究从商业问题、NLP任务、模型技术、数据集可用性、模型可复现性、语言及交换格式等维度进行剖析，指出现有研究的局限性，并为未来研究方向提出建议。
