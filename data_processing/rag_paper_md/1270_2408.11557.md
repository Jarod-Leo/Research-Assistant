原文摘要:
Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of
natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of
LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including
the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent
process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and
labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is
imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across
various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and
the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis.
Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an
effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval
remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we
first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP)
dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral
analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as
corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an
automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve
relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities
in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this
framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG
technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This
approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also
ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our
framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the
baseline.

大型语言模型（LLM）在通用领域的自然语言处理（NLP）任务中展现出显著成效，其出现为包括自然科学在内的多学科带来了方法论革新。研究者正致力于通过LLM驱动的自动化并发流程，替代传统人工重复性劳动。在光谱分析与检测领域，研究人员需自主获取涉及不同研究对象的光谱技术及实验分析中使用的化学计量学方法等核心知识。然而矛盾的是，尽管光谱检测被公认为有效分析手段，其基础知识检索过程仍具有耗时性与重复性。针对这一挑战，本研究首创了面向光谱分析与检测的开源文本知识数据集SDAAP（Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper），该数据集包含标注文献数据及对应知识指令数据。基于此，我们进一步设计了自动化问答框架，通过提取输入实体作为检索参数，实现相关知识检索与高质量回答生成。值得注意的是，该框架仅将LLM作为提供泛化能力的工具，同时采用RAG技术精准定位知识来源，既提升了生成回答的专业性，又确保了知识可追溯性。实验表明，相较于基线模型，本框架生成的回答具有更可靠的专业知识可信度。
