原文摘要:
Substance use disorder (SUD) poses a major concern due to its detrimental
effects on health and society. SUD identification and treatment depend on a
variety of factors such as severity, co-determinants (e.g., withdrawal
symptoms), and social determinants of health. Existing diagnostic coding
systems used by American insurance providers, like the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), lack granularity for certain diagnoses,
but clinicians will add this granularity (as that found within the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders classification or DSM-5) as
supplemental unstructured text in clinical notes. Traditional natural language
processing (NLP) methods face limitations in accurately parsing such diverse
clinical language. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in overcoming
these challenges by adapting to diverse language patterns. This study
investigates the application of LLMs for extracting severity-related
information for various SUD diagnoses from clinical notes. We propose a
workflow employing zero-shot learning of LLMs with carefully crafted prompts
and post-processing techniques. Through experimentation with Flan-T5, an
open-source LLM, we demonstrate its superior recall compared to the rule-based
approach. Focusing on 11 categories of SUD diagnoses, we show the effectiveness
of LLMs in extracting severity information, contributing to improved risk
assessment and treatment planning for SUD patients.

物质使用障碍（SUD）因其对健康与社会的危害性而成为重大公共卫生问题。其识别与治疗需综合考量严重程度、共病因素（如戒断症状）及健康社会决定因素等多重变量。美国医保机构采用的现行诊断编码体系（如ICD-10）对某些诊断缺乏细粒度分类，临床医师通常通过补充非结构化文本（参照DSM-5分类标准）来完善记录。传统自然语言处理（NLP）方法在解析此类复杂临床语言时存在局限，而大语言模型（LLM）凭借其强大的语言模式适应能力展现出突破潜力。本研究探索了利用LLM从临床记录中提取各类SUD诊断严重程度信息的方法，提出基于零样本学习的提示工程与后处理技术工作流程。通过开源模型Flan-T5的实验验证，其召回率显著优于基于规则的方法。针对11类SUD诊断的研究表明，LLM能有效提取严重程度信息，为优化患者风险评估与治疗规划提供新途径。
