原文摘要:
Document AI aims to automatically analyze documents by leveraging natural
language processing and computer vision techniques. One of the major tasks of
Document AI is document layout analysis, which structures document pages by
interpreting the content and spatial relationships of layout, image, and text.
This task can be image-centric, wherein the aim is to identify and label
various regions such as authors and paragraphs, or text-centric, where the
focus is on classifying individual words in a document. Although there are
increasingly sophisticated methods for improving layout analysis, doubts remain
about the extent to which their findings can be generalized to a broader
context. Specifically, prior work developed systems based on very different
architectures, such as transformer-based, graph-based, and CNNs. However, no
work has mentioned the effectiveness of these models in a comparative analysis.
Moreover, while language-independent Document AI models capable of knowledge
transfer have been developed, it remains to be investigated to what degree they
can effectively transfer knowledge. In this study, we aim to fill these gaps by
conducting a comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art models in document
layout analysis and investigating the potential of cross-lingual layout
analysis by utilizing machine translation techniques.

文档智能旨在通过自然语言处理与计算机视觉技术实现文档的自动化分析。其核心任务之一是文档版面分析，即通过解析版面、图像与文本的内容及空间关系来结构化文档页面。该任务可分为以图像为中心（识别并标注作者、段落等区域）和以文本为中心（对文档单词进行分类）两种范式。尽管版面分析方法日益精进，但其研究成果的泛化能力仍存疑。现有研究基于截然不同的架构开发系统，如基于Transformer、图神经网络和卷积网络的模型，但缺乏对这些模型效能的对比分析。此外，尽管已开发出具备知识迁移能力的语言无关文档智能模型，其跨语言知识迁移的有效性仍有待验证。本研究通过对比评估前沿版面分析模型，并借助机器翻译技术探索跨语言版面分析的潜力，致力于填补上述研究空白。
