# Exploring Large Language Models for Hate Speech Detection in Rioplatense Spanish

原文摘要:
Hate speech detection deals with many language variants, slang, slurs,
expression modalities, and cultural nuances. This outlines the importance of
working with specific corpora, when addressing hate speech within the scope of
Natural Language Processing, recently revolutionized by the irruption of Large
Language Models. This work presents a brief analysis of the performance of
large language models in the detection of Hate Speech for Rioplatense Spanish.
We performed classification experiments leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning
with ChatGPT 3.5, Mixtral, and Aya, comparing their results with those of a
state-of-the-art BERT classifier. These experiments outline that, even if large
language models show a lower precision compared to the fine-tuned BERT
classifier and, in some cases, they find hard-to-get slurs or colloquialisms,
they still are sensitive to highly nuanced cases (particularly,
homophobic/transphobic hate speech). We make our code and models publicly
available for future research.

仇恨言论检测涉及多种语言变体、俚语、侮辱用语、表达方式及文化细微差异。这凸显了在自然语言处理领域应对仇恨言论时，使用特定语料库的重要性——该领域近期因大语言模型的崛起而发生革命性变革。本研究简要分析了大语言模型在检测里奥普拉滕西西班牙语仇恨言论中的表现。我们通过思维链推理方法，对ChatGPT 3.5、Mixtral和Aya进行了分类实验，并将其结果与最先进的BERT分类器进行对比。实验表明：尽管大语言模型的精确度低于微调后的BERT分类器，且某些情况下难以识别生僻的侮辱语或俗语，但它们对高度微妙的案例（尤其是恐同/恐跨性别仇恨言论）仍具有敏感性。我们公开了代码和模型以供后续研究。
