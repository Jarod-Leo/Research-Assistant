# ChatGPT in the Age of Generative AI and Large Language Models: A Concise Survey

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04251v1

原文摘要:
ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) created by OpenAI that has been
carefully trained on a large amount of data. It has revolutionized the field of
natural language processing (NLP) and has pushed the boundaries of LLM
capabilities. ChatGPT has played a pivotal role in enabling widespread public
interaction with generative artificial intelligence (GAI) on a large scale. It
has also sparked research interest in developing similar technologies and
investigating their applications and implications. In this paper, our primary
goal is to provide a concise survey on the current lines of research on ChatGPT
and its evolution. We considered both the glass box and black box views of
ChatGPT, encompassing the components and foundational elements of the
technology, as well as its applications, impacts, and implications. The glass
box approach focuses on understanding the inner workings of the technology, and
the black box approach embraces it as a complex system, and thus examines its
inputs, outputs, and effects. This paves the way for a comprehensive
exploration of the technology and provides a road map for further research and
experimentation. We also lay out essential foundational literature on LLMs and
GAI in general and their connection with ChatGPT. This overview sheds light on
existing and missing research lines in the emerging field of LLMs, benefiting
both public users and developers. Furthermore, the paper delves into the broad
spectrum of applications and significant concerns in fields such as education,
research, healthcare, finance, etc.
