原文摘要:
Detecting plant diseases is a crucial aspect of modern agriculture - it plays
a key role in maintaining crop health and increasing overall yield. Traditional
approaches, though still valuable, often rely on manual inspection or
conventional machine learning techniques, both of which face limitations in
scalability and accuracy. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, offering benefits such as improved handling of
long-range dependencies and better scalability for visual tasks. This survey
explores the application of ViTs in precision agriculture, covering tasks from
classification to detection and segmentation. We begin by introducing the
foundational architecture of ViTs and discuss their transition from Natural
Language Processing (NLP) to computer vision. The discussion includes the
concept of inductive bias in traditional models like Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), and how ViTs mitigate these biases. We provide a comprehensive
review of recent literature, focusing on key methodologies, datasets, and
performance metrics. The survey also includes a comparative analysis of CNNs
and ViTs, with a look at hybrid models and performance enhancements. Technical
challenges - such as data requirements, computational demands, and model
interpretability - are addressed alongside potential solutions. Finally, we
outline potential research directions and technological advancements that could
further support the integration of ViTs in real-world agricultural settings.
Our goal with this study is to offer practitioners and researchers a deeper
understanding of how ViTs are poised to transform smart and precision
agriculture.
