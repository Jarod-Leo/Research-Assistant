# Large Language Model Adaptation for Financial Sentiment Analysis

原文摘要:
Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained relevance within
financial institutions by providing highly valuable insights into companies and
markets' financial documents. However, the landscape of the financial domain
presents extra challenges for NLP, due to the complexity of the texts and the
use of specific terminology. Generalist language models tend to fall short in
tasks specifically tailored for finance, even when using large language models
(LLMs) with great natural language understanding and generative capabilities.
This paper presents a study on LLM adaptation methods targeted at the financial
domain and with high emphasis on financial sentiment analysis. To this purpose,
two foundation models with less than 1.5B parameters have been adapted using a
wide range of strategies. We show that through careful fine-tuning on both
financial documents and instructions, these foundation models can be adapted to
the target domain. Moreover, we observe that small LLMs have comparable
performance to larger scale models, while being more efficient in terms of
parameters and data. In addition to the models, we show how to generate
artificial instructions through LLMs to augment the number of samples of the
instruction dataset.

自然语言处理（NLP）技术近期在金融机构中展现出重要价值，能够从企业及市场财务文档中提取高价值洞察。然而金融领域的文本复杂性和专业术语使用为NLP带来了特殊挑战。即便采用具备强大自然语言理解与生成能力的大语言模型（LLM），通用型语言模型在金融定制任务中仍表现欠佳。本文针对金融领域开展LLM适配方法研究，重点关注金融情感分析任务。通过采用多样化策略对两个参数量不足15亿的基础模型进行调优，我们证明：基于财务文档和指令数据的精细微调可有效实现领域适配。研究发现，小型LLM在参数效率和数据需求方面优势显著，其性能却能与更大规模模型媲美。此外，本文还展示了如何利用LLM生成人工指令以扩充指令数据集样本量的方法。
