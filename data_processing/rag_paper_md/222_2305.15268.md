原文摘要:
Events serve as fundamental units of occurrence within various contexts. The
processing of event semantics in textual information forms the basis of
numerous natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent studies have
begun leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address event semantic
processing. However, the extent that LLMs can effectively tackle these
challenges remains uncertain. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework for event semantic processing poses a significant
challenge in evaluating these capabilities. In this paper, we propose an
overarching framework for event semantic processing, encompassing
understanding, reasoning, and prediction, along with their fine-grained
aspects. To comprehensively evaluate the event semantic processing abilities of
models, we introduce a novel benchmark called EVEVAL. We collect 8 datasets
that cover all aspects of event semantic processing. Extensive experiments are
conducted on EVEVAL, leading to several noteworthy findings based on the
obtained results.

事件作为各类情境中的基本发生单元，其语义处理构成了众多自然语言处理应用的基础。近期研究开始探索利用大语言模型解决事件语义处理任务，然而这些模型应对相关挑战的实际能力仍不明确。此外，由于缺乏系统化的事件语义处理评估体系，模型能力的全面评测面临重大挑战。本文提出了涵盖理解、推理与预测三大维度及其细粒度层面的统一事件语义处理框架，并构建了新型评测基准EVEVAL。我们整合了覆盖事件语义处理全维度的8个数据集，通过大量实验得出了若干具有启示性的重要发现。
