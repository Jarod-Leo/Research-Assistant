原文摘要:
Causal inference has shown potential in enhancing the predictive accuracy,
fairness, robustness, and explainability of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models by capturing causal relationships among variables. The emergence of
generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various NLP
domains, particularly through their advanced reasoning capabilities. This
survey focuses on evaluating and improving LLMs from a causal view in the
following areas: understanding and improving the LLMs' reasoning capacity,
addressing fairness and safety issues in LLMs, complementing LLMs with
explanations, and handling multimodality. Meanwhile, LLMs' strong reasoning
capacities can in turn contribute to the field of causal inference by aiding
causal relationship discovery and causal effect estimations. This review
explores the interplay between causal inference frameworks and LLMs from both
perspectives, emphasizing their collective potential to further the development
of more advanced and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

因果推断通过捕捉变量间的因果关系，在提升自然语言处理（NLP）模型的预测准确性、公平性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面展现出潜力。生成式大语言模型（LLMs）的出现显著影响了多个NLP领域，尤其是其先进的推理能力。本综述从因果视角出发，重点评估和改进LLMs在以下方面的表现：理解与增强LLMs的推理能力、解决LLMs的公平性与安全问题、为LLMs补充解释机制以及处理多模态任务。同时，LLMs强大的推理能力也能反哺因果推断领域，辅助因果关系发现和因果效应估计。本文从双向视角探讨因果推断框架与LLMs之间的相互作用，强调二者协同推动更先进、更公平人工智能系统发展的共同潜力。
