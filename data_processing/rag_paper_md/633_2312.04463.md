# Leveraging Transformer-based Language Models to Automate Requirements Satisfaction Assessment

原文摘要:
Requirements Satisfaction Assessment (RSA) evaluates whether the set of
design elements linked to a single requirement provide sufficient coverage of
that requirement -- typically meaning that all concepts in the requirement are
addressed by at least one of the design elements. RSA is an important software
engineering activity for systems with any form of hierarchical decomposition --
especially safety or mission critical ones. In previous studies, researchers
used basic Information Retrieval (IR) models to decompose requirements and
design elements into chunks, and then evaluated the extent to which chunks of
design elements covered all chunks in the requirement. However, results had low
accuracy because many critical concepts that extend across the entirety of the
sentence were not well represented when the sentence was parsed into
independent chunks. In this paper we leverage recent advances in natural
language processing to deliver significantly more accurate results. We propose
two major architectures: Satisfaction BERT (Sat-BERT), and Dual-Satisfaction
BERT (DSat-BERT), along with their multitask learning variants to improve
satisfaction assessments. We perform RSA on five different datasets and compare
results from our variants against the chunk-based legacy approach. All
BERT-based models significantly outperformed the legacy baseline, and Sat-BERT
delivered the best results returning an average improvement of 124.75% in Mean
Average Precision.

需求满足度评估（RSA）旨在检验与单个需求相关联的设计元素集合是否充分覆盖了该需求——通常意味着需求中的所有概念都至少被一个设计元素所涵盖。对于采用任何形式层次化分解的系统（尤其是安全关键或任务关键型系统），RSA是一项重要的软件工程活动。在既往研究中，研究者使用基础信息检索（IR）模型将需求和设计元素分解为片段，进而评估设计元素片段对需求片段的覆盖程度。然而，由于许多贯穿整个句子的关键概念在被解析为独立片段时未能得到充分表征，该方法准确率较低。本文利用自然语言处理领域的最新进展，实现了显著更精确的评估结果。我们提出两大架构：满足度BERT（Sat-BERT）和双重满足度BERT（DSat-BERT），并通过其多任务学习变体来优化满足度评估。我们在五个不同数据集上实施RSA，并将新方法与基于片段的传统方法进行对比。所有基于BERT的模型均显著优于传统基线，其中Sat-BERT表现最佳，其平均精度均值（MAP）平均提升达124.75%。
