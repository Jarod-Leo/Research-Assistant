原文摘要:
Fine-grained visual recognition is to classify objects with visually similar
appearances into subcategories, which has made great progress with the
development of deep CNNs. However, handling subtle differences between
different subcategories still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose to
solve this issue in one unified framework from two aspects, i.e., constructing
feature-level interrelationships, and capturing part-level discriminative
features. This framework, namely PArt-guided Relational Transformers (PART), is
proposed to learn the discriminative part features with an automatic part
discovery module, and to explore the intrinsic correlations with a feature
transformation module by adapting the Transformer models from the field of
natural language processing. The part discovery module efficiently discovers
the discriminative regions which are highly-corresponded to the gradient
descent procedure. Then the second feature transformation module builds
correlations within the global embedding and multiple part embedding, enhancing
spatial interactions among semantic pixels. Moreover, our proposed approach
does not rely on additional part branches in the inference time and reaches
state-of-the-art performance on 3 widely-used fine-grained object recognition
benchmarks. Experimental results and explainable visualizations demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. The code can be found at

细粒度视觉识别旨在将外观高度相似的物体分类至子类别，随着深度卷积神经网络的发展已取得显著进展。然而，处理不同子类别间细微差异仍具挑战性。本文提出通过构建特征级关联关系和捕获部件级判别特征的双路径统一框架PART（部件引导关系变换器）来解决该问题。该框架通过自动部件发现模块学习判别性部件特征，并借鉴自然语言处理中的Transformer模型构建特征转换模块以挖掘内在关联。部件发现模块能高效定位与梯度下降过程高度相关的判别性区域，特征转换模块则建立全局嵌入与多部件嵌入间的关联，增强语义像素间的空间交互。值得注意的是，该方法在推理阶段无需额外部件分支，在三个广泛使用的细粒度物体识别基准测试中达到了最先进性能。实验结果与可解释性可视化验证了所提方法的有效性，代码已开源在https://github.com/iCVTEAM/PART。
