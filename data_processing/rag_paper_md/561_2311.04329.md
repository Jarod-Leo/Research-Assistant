# Formal Aspects of Language Modeling

原文摘要:
Large language models have become one of the most commonly deployed NLP
inventions. In the past half-decade, their integration into core natural
language processing tools has dramatically increased the performance of such
tools, and they have entered the public discourse surrounding artificial
intelligence. Consequently, it is important for both developers and researchers
alike to understand the mathematical foundations of large language models, as
well as how to implement them. These notes are the accompaniment to the
theoretical portion of the ETH Z\"urich course on large language models,
covering what constitutes a language model from a formal, theoretical
perspective.
