原文摘要:
Arabic poetry, with its rich linguistic features and profound cultural
significance, presents a unique challenge to the Natural Language Processing
(NLP) field. The complexity of its structure and context necessitates advanced
computational models for accurate analysis. In this paper, we introduce
AraPoemBERT, an Arabic language model pretrained exclusively on Arabic poetry
text. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compared
AraPoemBERT with 5 different Arabic language models on various NLP tasks
related to Arabic poetry. The new model outperformed all other models and
achieved state-of-the-art results in most of the downstream tasks. AraPoemBERT
achieved unprecedented accuracy in two out of three novel tasks: poet's gender
classification (99.34\% accuracy), and poetry sub-meter classification (97.79\%
accuracy). In addition, the model achieved an accuracy score in poems' rhyme
classification (97.73\% accuracy) which is almost equivalent to the best score
reported in this study. Moreover, the proposed model significantly outperformed
previous work and other comparative models in the tasks of poems' sentiment
analysis, achieving an accuracy of 78.95\%, and poetry meter classification
(99.03\% accuracy), while significantly expanding the scope of these two
problems. The dataset used in this study, contains more than 2.09 million
verses collected from online sources, each associated with various attributes
such as meter, sub-meter, poet, rhyme, and topic. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model in understanding and analyzing Arabic
poetry, achieving state-of-the-art results in several tasks and outperforming
previous works and other language models included in the study. AraPoemBERT
model is publicly available on \url{https://huggingface.co/faisalq}.

阿拉伯诗歌以其丰富的语言特征和深厚的文化内涵，为自然语言处理（NLP）领域带来了独特挑战。其结构与语境的复杂性要求采用先进的计算模型进行精准分析。本文提出AraPoemBERT——一个专为阿拉伯诗歌文本预训练的语言模型。为验证模型效能，我们在多项阿拉伯诗歌相关NLP任务中，将AraPoemBERT与5种不同阿拉伯语言模型进行对比。新模型在多数下游任务中表现卓越，取得了最先进的成果：在诗人性别分类（准确率99.34%）和诗歌子韵律分类（97.79%）两项创新任务中达到前所未有的精度；在诗歌韵脚分类（97.73%）任务中接近本研究报告的最佳水平；在诗歌情感分析（78.95%）和格律分类（99.03%）任务中显著超越既有研究，同时大幅扩展了这两类问题的研究范畴。本研究构建的数据集包含从网络资源收集的209万余行诗节，每行均标注有格律、子韵律、诗人、韵脚及主题等多维属性。实验结果表明，该模型在阿拉伯诗歌理解与分析方面成效显著，在多项任务中刷新性能纪录，全面超越现有研究及对比模型。AraPoemBERT模型已公开发布于\url{https://huggingface.co/faisalq}。
