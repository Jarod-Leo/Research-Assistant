原文摘要:
The importance of systems that can extract structured information from
textual data becomes increasingly pronounced given the ever-increasing volume
of text produced on a daily basis. Having a system that can effectively extract
such information in an interoperable manner would be an asset for several
domains, be it finance, health, or legal. Recent developments in natural
language processing led to the production of powerful language models that can,
to some degree, mimic human intelligence. Such effectiveness raises a pertinent
question: Can these models be leveraged for the extraction of structured
information? In this work, we address this question by evaluating the
capabilities of two state-of-the-art language models -- GPT-3 and GPT-3.5,
commonly known as ChatGPT -- in the extraction of narrative entities, namely
events, participants, and temporal expressions. This study is conducted on the
Text2Story Lusa dataset, a collection of 119 Portuguese news articles whose
annotation framework includes a set of entity structures along with several
tags and attribute values. We first select the best prompt template through an
ablation study over prompt components that provide varying degrees of
information on a subset of documents of the dataset. Subsequently, we use the
best templates to evaluate the effectiveness of the models on the remaining
documents. The results obtained indicate that GPT models are competitive with
out-of-the-box baseline systems, presenting an all-in-one alternative for
practitioners with limited resources. By studying the strengths and limitations
of these models in the context of information extraction, we offer insights
that can guide future improvements and avenues to explore in this field.

随着每日产生的文本数据量持续攀升，能够从文本中提取结构化信息的系统重要性日益凸显。一个能以可互操作方式高效提取此类信息的系统，将成为金融、医疗、法律等多个领域的宝贵资产。自然语言处理领域的最新进展催生了能够在一定程度上模拟人类智能的强大语言模型。这种效能引发了一个关键问题：能否利用这些模型进行结构化信息提取？本研究通过评估两种前沿语言模型——GPT-3和俗称ChatGPT的GPT-3.5——在叙事实体（包括事件、参与者和时间表达式）提取方面的能力来探讨该问题。实验基于Text2Story Lusa数据集展开，该数据集包含119篇葡萄牙语新闻文章，其标注框架涵盖一组实体结构及多个标签与属性值。我们首先通过消融实验，在数据集文档子集上测试提供不同信息量的提示模板组件，筛选出最佳提示模板；随后使用最优模板评估模型在剩余文档上的表现。结果表明，GPT模型与开箱即用的基线系统相比具有竞争力，为资源有限的实践者提供了一站式解决方案。通过剖析这些模型在信息提取任务中的优势与局限，本研究为该领域的未来改进方向提供了建设性见解。
