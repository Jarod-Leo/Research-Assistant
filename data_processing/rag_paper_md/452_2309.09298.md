原文摘要:
With the rapid development of IT operations, it has become increasingly
crucial to efficiently manage and analyze large volumes of data for practical
applications. The techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have shown
remarkable capabilities for various tasks, including named entity recognition,
machine translation and dialogue systems. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have achieved significant improvements across various NLP downstream
tasks. However, there is a lack of specialized LLMs for IT operations. In this
paper, we introduce the OWL, a large language model trained on our collected
OWL-Instruct dataset with a wide range of IT-related information, where the
mixture-of-adapter strategy is proposed to improve the parameter-efficient
tuning across different domains or tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of our OWL on the OWL-Bench established by us and open IT-related
benchmarks. OWL demonstrates superior performance results on IT tasks, which
outperforms existing models by significant margins. Moreover, we hope that the
findings of our work will provide more insights to revolutionize the techniques
of IT operations with specialized LLMs.

随着IT运维的快速发展，高效管理和分析海量数据对实际应用变得日益关键。自然语言处理（NLP）技术在命名实体识别、机器翻译和对话系统等任务中展现出卓越能力。近年来，大语言模型（LLMs）在各类NLP下游任务中取得显著突破，但针对IT运维领域的专用大模型仍属空白。本文提出OWL模型，该模型基于我们构建的涵盖广泛IT信息的OWL-Instruct数据集进行训练，并创新性地采用混合适配器策略以提升跨领域/跨任务的参数高效调优能力。我们在自建的OWL-Bench评估体系及公开IT基准测试上验证模型性能，结果表明OWL在IT任务中表现卓越，显著超越现有模型。本研究成果有望为IT运维技术变革提供新思路，推动领域专用大语言模型的发展。
