原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized many areas (e.g. natural
language processing, software engineering, etc.) by achieving state-of-the-art
performance on extensive downstream tasks. Aiming to achieve robust and general
artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating
the reasoning ability of the LLMs. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning
benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard
to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving
positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the
LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require
common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement
learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several
state-of-the-art LLMs' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic
programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative
and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis
systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust
deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples. Our evaluations illustrate that
compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in
model size, the state-of-the-art LLMs are much poorer in terms of reasoning
ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization using either
natural language prompting or truth-value matrix prompting.

大型语言模型（LLMs）通过在众多下游任务中实现最先进的性能，彻底改变了多个领域（如自然语言处理、软件工程等）。为追求稳健且通用的人工智能，研究者对LLMs推理能力的探索兴趣激增。然而，以往工作采用的文本与数值推理基准测试较为浅显简单，仅凭这些测试的积极结果难以断言LLMs具备强大的推理能力。近期研究表明，通过评估LLMs在强化学习基准上的表现，发现其难以解决需要常识规划的序列决策问题。本研究基于归纳逻辑编程（ILP）基准对多个前沿LLMs的推理能力进行深度评估——该基准被广泛视为评估逻辑程序归纳/合成系统的代表性挑战，因其要求通过严格的因果逻辑推导，在独立同分布（IID）和分布外（OOD）测试样本上实现稳健推理。实验结果表明：与模型规模小得多的神经程序归纳系统相比，当前最先进的LLMs无论是采用自然语言提示还是真值矩阵提示，其推理能力均显著不足，表现为性能与泛化能力大幅落后。
