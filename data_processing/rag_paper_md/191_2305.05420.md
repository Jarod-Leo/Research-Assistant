原文摘要:
'Mahabharata' is the most popular among many Indian pieces of literature
referred to in many domains for completely different purposes. This text itself
is having various dimension and aspects which is useful for the human being in
their personal life and professional life. This Indian Epic is originally
written in the Sanskrit Language. Now in the era of Natural Language
Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer
interaction this text can be processed according to the domain requirement. It
is interesting to process this text and get useful insights from Mahabharata.
The limitation of the humans while analyzing Mahabharata is that they always
have a sentiment aspect towards the story narrated by the author. Apart from
that, the human cannot memorize statistical or computational details, like
which two words are frequently coming in one sentence? What is the average
length of the sentences across the whole literature? Which word is the most
popular word across the text, what are the lemmas of the words used across the
sentences? Thus, in this paper, we propose an NLP pipeline to get some
statistical and computational insights along with the most relevant word
searching method from the largest epic 'Mahabharata'. We stacked the different
text-processing approaches to articulate the best results which can be further
used in the various domain where Mahabharata needs to be referred.

《摩诃婆罗多》是印度众多文学作品中最为人熟知的一部，常被不同领域引用以达成迥异目的。该文本本身具有多维视角与丰富内涵，对人们的个人生活与职业发展皆具指导意义。这部印度史诗原以梵文书写。在自然语言处理、人工智能、机器学习与人机交互技术蓬勃发展的今天，我们可以根据领域需求对该文本进行智能化处理。通过计算分析获取《摩诃婆罗多》的深层洞见颇具研究价值。人类在研读该史诗时存在天然局限：读者总会对作者叙述的故事产生情感倾向。此外，人类难以记忆统计与计算层面的细节，例如哪些词汇频繁共现于同一句子？全篇句子的平均长度是多少？文本中出现频率最高的词汇是什么？各句中词语的词元构成如何？为此，本文提出一种自然语言处理流程，旨在从这部宏大史诗中提取统计计算特征，并构建最相关词汇检索方法。我们通过整合多种文本处理技术来优化分析结果，这些成果可进一步应用于需要援引《摩诃婆罗多》的各类研究领域。
