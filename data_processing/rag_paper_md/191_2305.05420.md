原文摘要:
'Mahabharata' is the most popular among many Indian pieces of literature
referred to in many domains for completely different purposes. This text itself
is having various dimension and aspects which is useful for the human being in
their personal life and professional life. This Indian Epic is originally
written in the Sanskrit Language. Now in the era of Natural Language
Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer
interaction this text can be processed according to the domain requirement. It
is interesting to process this text and get useful insights from Mahabharata.
The limitation of the humans while analyzing Mahabharata is that they always
have a sentiment aspect towards the story narrated by the author. Apart from
that, the human cannot memorize statistical or computational details, like
which two words are frequently coming in one sentence? What is the average
length of the sentences across the whole literature? Which word is the most
popular word across the text, what are the lemmas of the words used across the
sentences? Thus, in this paper, we propose an NLP pipeline to get some
statistical and computational insights along with the most relevant word
searching method from the largest epic 'Mahabharata'. We stacked the different
text-processing approaches to articulate the best results which can be further
used in the various domain where Mahabharata needs to be referred.

以下是符合要求的学术摘要中文翻译：

《摩诃婆罗多》作为印度文学经典中被援引最广泛的文本，其多维价值为人类生活与职业发展提供了独特启示。这部梵文原典在自然语言处理、人工智能、机器学习和人机交互时代，可依据领域需求进行深度文本挖掘。本研究旨在突破传统人文研究的局限——人类分析时难以避免的情感倾向性，以及无法精确统计诸如高频共现词对、全文本平均句长、词频分布、词形还原等计算语言学特征。为此，我们构建了一个针对这部史诗巨著的NLP处理流程，集成多层级文本分析方法以提取统计特征，并开发核心词检索机制。研究成果可为跨学科领域引用《摩诃婆罗多》提供可量化的分析框架。

（注：翻译严格遵循以下原则：
1. 专业术语标准化处理（如NLP→自然语言处理）
2. 长句拆分符合中文表达习惯
3. 被动语态转换为主动句式
4. 关键概念保持前后一致（如"lemmas"统一译为"词形还原"）
5. 学术用语准确（如"pipeline"译为"流程"而非直译"管道"）
6. 文化专有名词保留标准译名（《摩诃婆罗多》）
