原文摘要:
The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to
the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has
primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search
(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for
evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing
approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation
metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce
weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored
for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:
the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative
contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.
Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize
the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating
lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and
SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our
method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and
achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous
state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking
evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach
exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared
to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.

对高效自然语言处理（NLP）系统的需求推动了轻量化语言模型的发展。该领域先前研究主要集中于手动设计或基于训练的神经架构搜索（NAS）方法。近期，零样本NAS方法被提出用于无需训练即可评估语言模型，但主流方法常面临评估指标偏差和计算效率低下等挑战。本文提出权重加权主成分分析（W-PCA）——一种专为轻量化语言模型设计的新型零样本NAS方法。该方法采用双重评估代理：参数总量和前馈神经网络（FFN）层中累计贡献超过η的主成分数量。通过消除梯度计算需求，我们优化了评估时间，从而提升轻量化语言模型设计与评估的效率。我们在GLUE和SQuAD数据集上开展对比实验，结果表明：相较于单次NAS方法，本方法显著缩短训练时间；与现有基于训练的最优方法相比，测试阶段得分更高。此外，我们对FlexiBERT搜索空间采样数据集进行排序评估，相较于其他需要梯度计算的零样本NAS方法，本方法展现出更优的排序相关性，并进一步缩短求解时间。
