# Large Language Models in Legislative Content Analysis: A Dataset from the Polish Parliament

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12100v1

原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) are among the best methods for processing
natural language, partly due to their versatility. At the same time,
domain-specific LLMs are more practical in real-life applications. This work
introduces a novel natural language dataset created by acquired data from
official legislative authorities' websites. The study focuses on formulating
three natural language processing (NLP) tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of
LLMs on legislative content analysis within the context of the Polish legal
system. Key findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating and
enhancing legislative content analysis while emphasizing specific challenges,
such as understanding legal context. The research contributes to the
advancement of NLP in the legal field, particularly in the Polish language. It
has been demonstrated that even commonly accessible data can be practically
utilized for legislative content analysis.

大型语言模型（LLM）因其多功能性成为处理自然语言的最佳方法之一。与此同时，特定领域的LLM在实际应用中更具实用性。本研究通过从官方立法机构网站获取数据，构建了一个新颖的自然语言数据集，重点设计了三项自然语言处理（NLP）任务，用于评估LLM在波兰法律体系下分析立法内容的效果。核心发现揭示了LLM在自动化和增强立法内容分析方面的潜力，同时强调了理解法律语境等具体挑战。该研究推动了NLP技术（尤其是波兰语领域）在法律领域的发展，并证明即使是普遍可获取的数据也能有效运用于立法内容分析实践。
