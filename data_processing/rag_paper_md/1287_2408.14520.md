原文摘要:
Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstrated
remarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domains
such as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval. This
approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models,
reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing
model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures
that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such
as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite
the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains
remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge
features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures
also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to
incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on
downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for
alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design
methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios
and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey
categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design
principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs,
molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review,
we provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to
impact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) community.

大规模“预训练与提示学习”范式展现出卓越的适应性，在问答系统、图像识别和多模态检索等广泛领域实现应用。该方法充分释放大规模预训练模型的潜力，降低下游数据需求与计算成本，同时提升模型跨任务的适用性。图作为一种能捕捉实体间关系的通用数据结构，在社交网络分析、推荐系统和生物图谱等领域具有关键作用。尽管预训练与提示学习范式在自然语言处理（NLP）和计算机视觉（CV）领域取得成功，但其在图领域的应用仍处于萌芽阶段。在图结构数据中，不仅节点与边的特征分布常存在差异，拓扑结构也往往迥异。这种图数据的多样性可能导致预训练与下游图微调之间存在模式不兼容或鸿沟。我们旨在通过总结缓解这些差异的方法来弥合这一鸿沟，包括探索提示设计方法学、比较相关技术、评估应用场景与数据集，并指出未解决问题与挑战。本综述对该领域100余篇相关工作进行系统分类，归纳通用设计原则与最新应用（包括文本属性图、分子、蛋白质和推荐系统等），通过全面梳理为图提示学习建立基础认知，期望不仅影响图挖掘社区，更能推动通用人工智能（AGI）领域的进步。
