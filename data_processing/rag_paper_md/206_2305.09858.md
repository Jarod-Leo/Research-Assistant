原文摘要:
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) play a crucial role in enhancing e-commerce system
performance by providing structured information about entities and their
relationships, such as complementary or substitutable relations between
products or product types, which can be utilized in recommender systems.
However, relation labeling in KGs remains a challenging task due to the dynamic
nature of e-commerce domains and the associated cost of human labor. Recently,
breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising results in
numerous natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study of LLMs for relation labeling in e-commerce KGs, investigating
their powerful learning capabilities in natural language and effectiveness in
predicting relations between product types with limited labeled data. We
evaluate various LLMs, including PaLM and GPT-3.5, on benchmark datasets,
demonstrating their ability to achieve competitive performance compared to
humans on relation labeling tasks using just 1 to 5 labeled examples per
relation. Additionally, we experiment with different prompt engineering
techniques to examine their impact on model performance. Our results show that
LLMs significantly outperform existing KG completion models in relation
labeling for e-commerce KGs and exhibit performance strong enough to replace
human labeling.

知识图谱（KGs）通过提供实体及其关系的结构化信息（如商品或商品品类间的互补、替代关系），在提升电商系统性能方面发挥着关键作用，这些信息可被推荐系统有效利用。然而，由于电商领域的动态特性及人工标注的高成本，知识图谱中的关系标注仍是一项具有挑战性的任务。近期，大语言模型（LLMs）在多项自然语言处理任务中展现出突破性进展。本文针对电商知识图谱的关系标注任务开展实证研究，探究大语言模型在自然语言方面的强大学习能力，以及其在有限标注数据下预测商品品类关系的有效性。我们在基准数据集上评估了包括PaLM和GPT-3.5在内的多种大语言模型，结果表明：仅需每个关系1至5个标注样本，这些模型在关系标注任务上就能达到与人工标注相媲美的性能。此外，我们通过不同提示工程技术验证其对模型性能的影响。实验结果显示，大语言模型在电商知识图谱关系标注任务上显著优于现有知识图谱补全模型，其表现足以取代人工标注。
