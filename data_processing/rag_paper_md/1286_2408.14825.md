原文摘要:
With the growing Deaf and Hard of Hearing population worldwide and the
persistent shortage of certified sign language interpreters, there is a
pressing need for an efficient, signs-driven, integrated end-to-end translation
system, from sign to gloss to text and vice-versa. There has been a wealth of
research on machine translations and related reviews. However, there are few
works on sign language machine translation considering the particularity of the
language being continuous and dynamic. This paper aims to address this void,
providing a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of sign language
machine translation algorithms and a taxonomy of the Transformers
architectures, the most used approach in language translation. We also present
the requirements of a real-time Quality-of-Service sign language ma-chine
translation system underpinned by accurate deep learning algorithms. We propose
future research directions for sign language translation systems.

随着全球聋哑及听力障碍人群的持续增长与专业手语译员的长期短缺，构建一套从手语动作到语标再到文本（或逆向）的高效、手语驱动、端到端集成翻译系统显得尤为迫切。尽管机器翻译领域已有丰富的研究成果及相关综述，但针对手语这种连续动态语言特殊性的机器翻译研究仍属稀缺。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过回溯性分析手语机器翻译算法的时间演进历程，并对当前语言翻译中最主流的Transformer架构进行系统分类。同时，我们阐述了基于精准深度学习算法的实时服务质量保障型手语机器翻译系统所需的技术要件，并提出了手语翻译系统未来的研究方向。
