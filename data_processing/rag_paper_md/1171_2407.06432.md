原文摘要:
The influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly growing, automating
more jobs over time. Assessing the fairness of LLMs is crucial due to their
expanding impact. Studies reveal the reflection of societal norms and biases in
LLMs, which creates a risk of propagating societal stereotypes in downstream
tasks. Many studies on bias in LLMs focus on gender bias in various NLP
applications. However, there's a gap in research on bias in emotional
attributes, despite the close societal link between emotion and gender. This
gap is even larger for low-resource languages like Bangla. Historically, women
are associated with emotions like empathy, fear, and guilt, while men are
linked to anger, bravado, and authority. This pattern reflects societal norms
in Bangla-speaking regions. We offer the first thorough investigation of
gendered emotion attribution in Bangla for both closed and open source LLMs in
this work. Our aim is to elucidate the intricate societal relationship between
gender and emotion specifically within the context of Bangla. We have been
successful in showing the existence of gender bias in the context of emotions
in Bangla through analytical methods and also show how emotion attribution
changes on the basis of gendered role selection in LLMs. All of our resources
including code and data are made publicly available to support future research
on Bangla NLP.

大型语言模型（LLMs）的影响力正迅速扩大，逐步自动化更多工作岗位。鉴于其日益增长的影响，评估LLMs的公平性至关重要。研究表明，LLMs反映了社会规范与偏见，这可能导致下游任务中传播社会刻板印象的风险。许多关于LLMs偏见的研究聚焦于各类自然语言处理应用中的性别偏见。然而，尽管情感与性别在社会中紧密关联，关于情感属性偏见的研究仍存在空白。对于孟加拉语等低资源语言，这一研究缺口更为显著。历史上，女性常被赋予共情、恐惧和内疚等情感特质，而男性则与愤怒、虚张声势和权威相联系——这种模式在孟加拉语地区的社会规范中尤为明显。本研究首次对孟加拉语中闭源与开源LLMs的性别化情感归因进行了系统考察，旨在揭示孟加拉语语境下性别与情感之间复杂的社会关联。我们通过分析方法成功证明了孟加拉语情感语境中性别偏见的存在，并展示了LLMs中基于性别化角色选择的情感归因变化。所有研究资源（包括代码与数据）均已公开，以支持未来孟加拉语自然语言处理研究。
