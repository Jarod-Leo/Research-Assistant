# REQUAL-LM: Reliability and Equity through Aggregation in Large Language Models

原文摘要:
The extensive scope of large language models (LLMs) across various domains
underscores the critical importance of responsibility in their application,
beyond natural language processing. In particular, the randomized nature of
LLMs, coupled with inherent biases and historical stereotypes in data, raises
critical concerns regarding reliability and equity. Addressing these challenges
are necessary before using LLMs for applications with societal impact. Towards
addressing this gap, we introduce REQUAL-LM, a novel method for finding
reliable and equitable LLM outputs through aggregation. Specifically, we
develop a Monte Carlo method based on repeated sampling to find a reliable
output close to the mean of the underlying distribution of possible outputs. We
formally define the terms such as reliability and bias, and design an
equity-aware aggregation to minimize harmful bias while finding a highly
reliable output. REQUAL-LM does not require specialized hardware, does not
impose a significant computing load, and uses LLMs as a blackbox. This design
choice enables seamless scalability alongside the rapid advancement of LLM
technologies. Our system does not require retraining the LLMs, which makes it
deployment ready and easy to adapt. Our comprehensive experiments using various
tasks and datasets demonstrate that REQUAL- LM effectively mitigates bias and
selects a more equitable response, specifically the outputs that properly
represents minority groups.

大型语言模型（LLMs）在各领域的广泛应用凸显了其应用责任的重要性，这已超越自然语言处理本身。尤其值得注意的是，LLMs的随机性特质，加之数据中固有的偏见与历史刻板印象，引发了关于模型可靠性与公平性的核心关切。在将LLMs应用于具有社会影响力的场景前，解决这些挑战势在必行。为此，我们提出了REQUAL-LM这一创新方法，通过聚合机制筛选可靠且公平的LLM输出。具体而言，我们开发了一种基于重复采样的蒙特卡洛方法，以寻找接近潜在输出分布均值的可靠结果。我们正式定义了可靠性与偏见等术语，并设计了兼顾公平性的聚合策略——在确保高可靠性输出的同时，最大限度减少有害偏见。REQUAL-LM无需专用硬件支持，不会显著增加计算负荷，且将LLMs视为黑箱操作。这一设计使其能随着LLM技术的快速发展无缝扩展。该系统无需重新训练LLMs，具备即装即用的部署优势与良好的适应性。通过多任务、多数据集的全面实验验证，REQUAL-LM能有效缓解偏见并选择更具公平性的响应，特别是那些能恰当代表少数群体的输出结果。
