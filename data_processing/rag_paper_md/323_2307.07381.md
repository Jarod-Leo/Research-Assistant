原文摘要:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Requirements Engineering (RE) (NLP4RE)
seeks to apply NLP tools, techniques, and resources to the RE process to
increase the quality of the requirements. There is little research involving
the utilization of Generative AI-based NLP tools and techniques for
requirements elicitation. In recent times, Large Language Models (LLM) like
ChatGPT have gained significant recognition due to their notably improved
performance in NLP tasks. To explore the potential of ChatGPT to assist in
requirements elicitation processes, we formulated six questions to elicit
requirements using ChatGPT. Using the same six questions, we conducted
interview-based surveys with five RE experts from academia and industry and
collected 30 responses containing requirements. The quality of these 36
responses (human-formulated + ChatGPT-generated) was evaluated over seven
different requirements quality attributes by another five RE experts through a
second round of interview-based surveys. In comparing the quality of
requirements generated by ChatGPT with those formulated by human experts, we
found that ChatGPT-generated requirements are highly Abstract, Atomic,
Consistent, Correct, and Understandable. Based on these results, we present the
most pressing issues related to LLMs and what future research should focus on
to leverage the emergent behaviour of LLMs more effectively in natural
language-based RE activities.

面向需求工程的自然语言处理技术（NLP4RE）旨在将NLP工具、方法与资源应用于需求工程流程，以提升需求质量。目前关于采用生成式AI驱动的NLP工具与技术进行需求获取的研究较为匮乏。近年来，以ChatGPT为代表的大语言模型（LLM）因其在NLP任务中的显著性能提升而备受关注。为探索ChatGPT辅助需求获取的潜力，我们设计六个问题通过ChatGPT获取需求，并邀请五位来自学界与业界的需求工程专家就相同问题进行访谈调查，共收集30份人工生成的需求响应。随后由另外五位专家通过第二轮访谈调查，从七个需求质量维度对这36份响应（人工生成+ChatGPT生成）进行评估。对比分析显示，ChatGPT生成的需求在抽象性、原子性、一致性、正确性和可理解性方面表现优异。基于研究结果，我们提出了大语言模型应用中最亟待解决的问题，并指出未来研究应如何更有效地利用LLMs在自然语言需求工程活动中展现的涌现特性。
