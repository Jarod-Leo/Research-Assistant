原文摘要:
In recent years, language models (LMs), such as GPT-4, have been widely used
in multiple domains, including natural language processing, visualization, and
so on. However, applying them for analyzing and optimizing high-performance
computing (HPC) software is still challenging due to the lack of HPC-specific
support. In this paper, we design the LM4HPC framework to facilitate the
research and development of HPC software analyses and optimizations using LMs.
Tailored for supporting HPC datasets, AI models, and pipelines, our framework
is built on top of a range of components from different levels of the machine
learning software stack, with Hugging Face-compatible APIs. Using three
representative tasks, we evaluated the prototype of our framework. The results
show that LM4HPC can help users quickly evaluate a set of state-of-the-art
models and generate insightful leaderboards.

近年来，以GPT-4为代表的大语言模型（LMs）已广泛应用于自然语言处理、可视化等多个领域。然而，由于缺乏面向高性能计算（HPC）的专业支持，将其应用于分析和优化HPC软件仍面临挑战。本文设计了LM4HPC框架，旨在利用大语言模型促进HPC软件分析与优化技术的研发。该框架通过适配HPC专用数据集、AI模型和处理流程，基于机器学习软件栈的多层次组件构建，并提供兼容Hugging Face的应用程序接口。通过三项典型任务的验证测试，评估结果表明LM4HPC能帮助用户快速评估前沿模型性能并生成具有洞察力的排行榜单。
