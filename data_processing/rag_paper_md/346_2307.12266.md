原文摘要:
The Space-Air-Ground-Sea integrated network calls for more robust and secure
transmission techniques against jamming. In this paper, we propose a textual
semantic transmission framework for robust transmission, which utilizes the
advanced natural language processing techniques to model and encode sentences.
Specifically, the textual sentences are firstly split into tokens using
wordpiece algorithm, and are embedded to token vectors for semantic extraction
by Transformer-based encoder. The encoded data are quantized to a fixed length
binary sequence for transmission, where binary erasure, symmetric, and deletion
channels are considered for transmission. The received binary sequences are
further decoded by the transformer decoders into tokens used for sentence
reconstruction. Our proposed approach leverages the power of neural networks
and attention mechanism to provide reliable and efficient communication of
textual data in challenging wireless environments, and simulation results on
semantic similarity and bilingual evaluation understudy prove the superiority
of the proposed model in semantic transmission.

天地海空一体化网络对通信抗干扰能力提出了更高要求。本文提出了一种基于文本语义的鲁棒传输框架，通过先进自然语言处理技术实现语句建模与编码。具体而言，文本语句首先采用词片算法进行分词处理，经嵌入层转换为词向量后，由基于Transformer的编码器提取语义特征。量化后的语义数据以固定长度二进制序列传输，并考虑了二进制擦除、对称及删除三类信道模型。接收端通过Transformer解码器重构语义单元用于语句恢复。该方案利用神经网络与注意力机制的优势，在复杂无线环境下实现了文本数据的高效可靠传输。语义相似度与双语评估替补测试结果表明，所提模型在语义传输方面具有显著优势。
