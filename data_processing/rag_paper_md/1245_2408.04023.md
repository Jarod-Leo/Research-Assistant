原文摘要:
As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly sophisticated and
ubiquitous in natural language processing (NLP) applications, ensuring their
robustness, trustworthiness, and alignment with human values has become a
critical challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for contextual
grounding in textual models, with a particular emphasis on the Context
Representation stage. Our approach aims to enhance the reliability and ethical
alignment of these models through a comprehensive, context-aware methodology.
By explicitly capturing and representing relevant situational, cultural, and
ethical contexts in a machine-readable format, we lay the foundation for
anchoring a model's behavior within these contexts. Our approach leverages
techniques from knowledge representation and reasoning, such as ontologies,
semantic web technologies, and logic-based formalisms. We evaluate our
framework on real-world textual datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving model performance, fairness, and alignment with human expectations,
while maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the other key
components of the framework, including context-aware encoding, context-aware
learning, interpretability and explainability, and continuous monitoring and
adaptation. This research contributes to the growing body of work on
responsible AI, offering a practical approach to developing more reliable,
trustworthy, and ethically-aligned language models. Our findings have
significant implications for the deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains such
as healthcare, legal systems, and social services, where contextual
understanding is paramount.
