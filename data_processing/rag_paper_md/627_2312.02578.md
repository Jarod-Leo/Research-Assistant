原文摘要:
This paper presents our approach for the WASSA 2023 Empathy, Emotion and
Personality Shared Task. Empathy and distress are human feelings that are
implicitly expressed in natural discourses. Empathy and distress detection are
crucial challenges in Natural Language Processing that can aid our
understanding of conversations. The provided dataset consists of several
long-text examples in the English language, with each example associated with a
numeric score for empathy and distress. We experiment with several BERT-based
models as a part of our approach. We also try various ensemble methods. Our
final submission has a Pearson's r score of 0.346, placing us third in the
empathy and distress detection subtask.

本文介绍了我们参与WASSA 2023共情、情感与人格特征共享任务的技术方案。共情与痛苦是人类在自然语篇中隐性表达的情感状态，其自动检测作为自然语言处理领域的关键挑战，对深化对话理解具有重要意义。任务数据集包含多个英语长文本样本，每个样本均标注有共情与痛苦程度的数值评分。我们的研究方法以基于BERT的多种模型为核心，并尝试了不同集成策略。最终提交方案在共情与痛苦检测子任务中取得了0.346的皮尔逊相关系数，位列排行榜第三名。
