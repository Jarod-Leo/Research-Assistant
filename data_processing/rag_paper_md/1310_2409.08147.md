原文摘要:
Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis
remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating
presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding
challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that
analyzes candidates' "Policies, Persona, and Perspective" (3P) and how they
resonate with the "Interests, Ideologies, and Identity" (3I) of four key
audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method
employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative
measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We
apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential
debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional
assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the
effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various
audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis
but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial
judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides
individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate
performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on
potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby
strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.

大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域展现出卓越能力，但其在政治话语分析中的应用仍待深入探索。本文提出一种创新方法，利用大语言模型评估总统辩论表现，以解决长期以来辩论结果客观评估的难题。我们构建了一个分析框架，通过考察候选人的"政策主张、个人形象与核心观点"（3P要素）如何与四大关键受众群体——选民、企业、捐助者和政界人士——的"利益诉求、意识形态与身份认同"（3I要素）产生共鸣。该方法运用大语言模型生成"LLM-POTUS评分"，通过量化3P与3I的契合度来衡量辩论表现。我们将此框架应用于近期美国总统辩论的文本分析，证明其能提供细致入微、多维度的候选人表现评估。研究结果揭示了不同辩论策略的有效性及其对各受众群体的差异化影响。本研究不仅为政治分析提供了新工具，更探讨了大语言模型在复杂社会语境中担任中立裁判的潜力与局限。此外，该框架为公民个体提供了独立评估总统辩论表现的工具，既能增强民主参与度，又可减少对可能存在偏见的媒体解读与体制影响的依赖，从而夯实公民理性参与的政治基础。
