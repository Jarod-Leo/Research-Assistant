# Explicit Planning Helps Language Models in Logical Reasoning

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15714v1

原文摘要:
Language models have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of
natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose LEAP, a novel
system that uses language models to perform multi-step logical reasoning and
incorporates explicit planning into the inference procedure. Explicit planning
enables the system to make more informed reasoning decisions at each step by
looking ahead into their future effects. Moreover, we propose a training
strategy that safeguards the planning process from being led astray by spurious
features. Our full system significantly outperforms other competing methods on
multiple standard datasets. When using small T5 models as its core selection
and deduction components, our system performs competitively compared to GPT-3
despite having only about 1B parameters (i.e., 175 times smaller than GPT-3).
When using GPT-3.5, it significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting on
the challenging PrOntoQA dataset. We have conducted extensive empirical studies
to demonstrate that explicit planning plays a crucial role in the system's
performance.

研究表明，语言模型在各类自然语言处理任务中表现卓越。本文提出LEAP系统，该系统创新性地利用语言模型进行多步逻辑推理，并将显式规划融入推理过程。通过前瞻性规划，系统能在每一步推理时基于未来潜在影响做出更明智的决策。我们还提出一种训练策略，可防止规划过程被虚假特征误导。在多个标准数据集测试中，完整系统性能显著优于其他方法：当采用小型T5模型作为核心选择和推理组件时，仅需约10亿参数（约为GPT-3的1/175）即可达到与GPT-3相当的竞争力；使用GPT-3.5时，在具有挑战性的PrOntoQA数据集上显著超越思维链提示方法。大量实证研究表明，显式规划对系统性能提升具有关键作用。
