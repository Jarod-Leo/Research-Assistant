原文摘要:
In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has been rapidly
developing. Among them, OpenAI's ChatGPT excels at natural language processing
tasks and can also generate source code. However, the generated code often has
problems with consistency and program rules. Therefore, in this research, we
developed a system that tests the code generated by ChatGPT, automatically
corrects it if it is inappropriate, and presents the appropriate code to the
user. This study aims to address the challenge of reducing the manual effort
required for the human feedback and modification process for generated code.
When we ran the system, we were able to automatically modify the code as
intended.

近年来，人工智能领域发展迅猛。其中，OpenAI推出的ChatGPT不仅擅长自然语言处理任务，还能生成程序源代码。但生成的代码常存在一致性与程序规范方面的问题。为此，本研究开发了一套系统：对ChatGPT生成的代码进行测试，若存在不当之处则自动修正，最终向用户呈现符合要求的代码。本研究致力于解决如何减少人工对生成代码进行反馈与修改所需投入的难题。实际运行系统时，我们成功实现了代码的自动化预期修改。
