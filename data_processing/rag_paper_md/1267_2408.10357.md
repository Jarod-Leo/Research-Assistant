# Beyond Relevant Documents: A Knowledge-Intensive Approach for Query-Focused Summarization using Large Language Models

原文摘要:
Query-focused summarization (QFS) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing with broad applications, including search engines and report
generation. However, traditional approaches assume the availability of relevant
documents, which may not always hold in practical scenarios, especially in
highly specialized topics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
knowledge-intensive approach that reframes QFS as a knowledge-intensive task
setup. This approach comprises two main components: a retrieval module and a
summarization controller. The retrieval module efficiently retrieves
potentially relevant documents from a large-scale knowledge corpus based on the
given textual query, eliminating the dependence on pre-existing document sets.
The summarization controller seamlessly integrates a powerful large language
model (LLM)-based summarizer with a carefully tailored prompt, ensuring the
generated summary is comprehensive and relevant to the query. To assess the
effectiveness of our approach, we create a new dataset, along with
human-annotated relevance labels, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation
covering both retrieval and summarization performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, particularly its ability
to generate accurate summaries without relying on the availability of relevant
documents initially. This underscores our method's versatility and practical
applicability across diverse query scenarios.

查询聚焦式摘要（Query-focused Summarization, QFS）是自然语言处理领域的一项基础任务，在搜索引擎和报告生成等场景中具有广泛应用。然而传统方法通常假设相关文档已预先存在，这一前提在实际应用中往往难以满足，尤其针对高度专业化的主题。为突破这一局限，我们提出了一种创新的知识密集型解决方案，将QFS重构为知识密集型任务框架。该框架包含两大核心组件：检索模块通过大规模知识库对文本查询进行高效检索，摆脱了对预设文档集的依赖；摘要控制器则通过精心设计的提示模板，将强大的大语言模型摘要生成器无缝集成，确保输出摘要兼具全面性和查询相关性。为验证方法有效性，我们构建了包含人工标注相关性标签的新数据集，支持对检索与摘要性能的全面评估。大量实验表明，我们的方法尤其在初始无相关文档条件下仍能生成准确摘要，展现出卓越性能。这充分证明了本方案在不同查询场景下的通用性和实践价值。
