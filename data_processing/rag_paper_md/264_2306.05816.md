# Detecting Phishing Sites Using ChatGPT

原文摘要:
The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, is having a
significant impact on a wide range of fields. While LLMs have been extensively
researched for tasks such as code generation and text synthesis, their
application in detecting malicious web content, particularly phishing sites,
has been largely unexplored. To combat the rising tide of cyber attacks due to
the misuse of LLMs, it is important to automate detection by leveraging the
advanced capabilities of LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel system called ChatPhishDetector that
utilizes LLMs to detect phishing sites. Our system involves leveraging a web
crawler to gather information from websites, generating prompts for LLMs based
on the crawled data, and then retrieving the detection results from the
responses generated by the LLMs. The system enables us to detect multilingual
phishing sites with high accuracy by identifying impersonated brands and social
engineering techniques in the context of the entire website, without the need
to train machine learning models. To evaluate the performance of our system, we
conducted experiments on our own dataset and compared it with baseline systems
and several LLMs. The experimental results using GPT-4V demonstrated
outstanding performance, with a precision of 98.7% and a recall of 99.6%,
outperforming the detection results of other LLMs and existing systems. These
findings highlight the potential of LLMs for protecting users from online
fraudulent activities and have important implications for enhancing
cybersecurity measures.

以ChatGPT为代表的大型语言模型（LLM）的出现正深刻影响着众多领域。尽管LLM在代码生成、文本合成等任务中已得到广泛研究，但其在检测恶意网络内容（尤其是钓鱼网站）方面的应用仍鲜有探索。面对因LLM滥用而激增的网络攻击，利用LLM的先进能力实现自动化检测至关重要。

本文提出了一种名为ChatPhishDetector的新型系统，通过LLM实现钓鱼网站检测。该系统首先利用网络爬虫采集网站信息，基于爬取数据生成LLM提示词，再从模型响应中提取检测结果。该方法无需训练机器学习模型，即可通过识别网站整体上下文中的仿冒品牌与社会工程学手段，实现高准确率的多语言钓鱼网站检测。为评估系统性能，我们在自建数据集上进行实验，并与基线系统及多种LLM进行对比。使用GPT-4V的实验结果显示其精确率达98.7%、召回率达99.6%，显著优于其他LLM及现有系统的检测效果。这些发现证明了LLM在保护用户免受网络欺诈活动方面的潜力，对加强网络安全措施具有重要意义。
