原文摘要:
While IoT devices provide significant benefits, their rapid growth results in
larger data volumes, increased complexity, and higher security risks. To manage
these issues, techniques like encryption, compression, and mapping are used to
process data efficiently and securely. General-purpose and AI platforms handle
these tasks well, but mapping in natural language processing is often slowed by
training times. This work explores a self-explanatory, training-free mapping
transformer based on non-deterministic finite automata, designed for
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Besides highlighting the advantages of
this proposed approach in providing real-time, cost-effective processing and
dataset-loading, we also address the challenges and considerations for
enhancing the design in future iterations.

尽管物联网设备带来了显著效益，但其快速增长也导致数据量激增、系统复杂度上升及安全风险加剧。为应对这些问题，业界采用加密、压缩和映射等技术来实现高效安全的数据处理。通用计算平台与人工智能平台虽能良好执行这些任务，但自然语言处理中的映射常因训练耗时导致效率降低。本研究提出一种基于非确定性有限状态机的自解释型免训练映射转换器，专为现场可编程门阵列（FPGA）设计。在重点阐述该方案实时处理、成本效益及数据集加载优势的同时，我们也探讨了未来迭代设计中需要解决的挑战与优化方向。
