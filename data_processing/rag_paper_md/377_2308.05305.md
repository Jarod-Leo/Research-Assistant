原文摘要:
Medical image segmentation is an important step in medical image analysis,
especially as a crucial prerequisite for efficient disease diagnosis and
treatment. The use of deep learning for image segmentation has become a
prevalent trend. The widely adopted approach currently is U-Net and its
variants. Additionally, with the remarkable success of pre-trained models in
natural language processing tasks, transformer-based models like TransUNet have
achieved desirable performance on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.
In this paper, we conduct a survey of the most representative four medical
image segmentation models in recent years. We theoretically analyze the
characteristics of these models and quantitatively evaluate their performance
on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Tuberculosis Chest X-rays and ovarian tumors).
Finally, we discuss the main challenges and future trends in medical image
segmentation. Our work can assist researchers in the related field to quickly
establish medical segmentation models tailored to specific regions.

医学图像分割是医学图像分析中的重要步骤，尤其作为疾病高效诊断与治疗的关键前提。采用深度学习进行图像分割已成为主流趋势，目前广泛采用的方法是U-Net及其变体。此外，随着预训练模型在自然语言处理任务中的显著成功，基于Transformer的模型（如TransUNet）在多个医学图像分割数据集上取得了理想性能。本文对近年来最具代表性的四种医学图像分割模型进行综述，从理论上分析这些模型的特点，并在两个基准数据集（即结核病胸部X光片和卵巢肿瘤）上定量评估其性能。最后，我们探讨了医学图像分割面临的主要挑战与未来趋势。本项工作可帮助相关领域研究者快速建立针对特定区域的医学分割模型。
