原文摘要:
Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a recently proposed task of
aspect-based sentiment analysis that consists in extracting (aspect phrase,
opinion phrase, sentiment polarity) triples from a given sentence. Recent
state-of-the-art methods approach this task by first extracting all possible
text spans from a given text, then filtering the potential aspect and opinion
phrases with a classifier, and finally considering all their pairs with another
classifier that additionally assigns sentiment polarity to them. Although
several variations of the above scheme have been proposed, the common feature
is that the final result is constructed by a sequence of independent classifier
decisions. This hinders the exploitation of dependencies between extracted
phrases and prevents the use of knowledge about the interrelationships between
classifier predictions to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a new
ASTE approach consisting of three transformer-inspired layers, which enables
the modelling of dependencies both between phrases and between the final
classifier decisions. Experimental results show that the method achieves higher
performance in terms of F1 measure than other methods studied on popular
benchmarks. In addition, we show that a simple pre-training technique further
improves the performance of the model.

方面情感三元组抽取（ASTE）是近期提出的基于方面的情感分析任务，旨在从给定句子中提取（方面短语、观点短语、情感极性）三元组。当前最先进的方法通常采用多阶段流程：首先从文本中抽取所有可能的文本片段，随后通过分类器筛选潜在的方面和观点短语，最后利用另一个分类器评估所有短语组合并分配情感极性。尽管已有多种改进方案，但这些方法的共同特点在于最终结果由一系列独立分类器决策串联构成。这种架构既难以捕捉抽取短语间的依存关系，也无法利用分类器预测间的关联知识来提升性能。

本文提出了一种新型ASTE方法，其核心是由三个受Transformer启发的层级结构组成，能够同时建模短语间关系与最终分类决策间的依赖关系。实验结果表明，在多个主流基准测试中，该方法在F1值指标上均优于现有其他方法。此外，我们通过实验证明，采用简单的预训练技术可进一步提升模型性能。
