原文摘要:
Sentiment analysis (SA) has been a long-standing research area in natural
language processing. It can offer rich insights into human sentiments and
opinions and has thus seen considerable interest from both academia and
industry. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
there is a great potential for their employment on SA problems. However, the
extent to which existing LLMs can be leveraged for different sentiment analysis
tasks remains unclear. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive investigation
into the capabilities of LLMs in performing various sentiment analysis tasks,
from conventional sentiment classification to aspect-based sentiment analysis
and multifaceted analysis of subjective texts. We evaluate performance across
13 tasks on 26 datasets and compare the results against small language models
(SLMs) trained on domain-specific datasets. Our study reveals that while LLMs
demonstrate satisfactory performance in simpler tasks, they lag behind in more
complex tasks requiring deeper understanding or structured sentiment
information. However, LLMs significantly outperform SLMs in few-shot learning
settings, suggesting their potential when annotation resources are limited. We
also highlight the limitations of current evaluation practices in assessing
LLMs' SA abilities and propose a novel benchmark, \textsc{SentiEval}, for a
more comprehensive and realistic evaluation. Data and code during our
investigations are available at

情感分析（Sentiment Analysis, SA）作为自然语言处理领域的一项长期研究课题，能够深入揭示人类情感与观点倾向，因而持续受到学术界与工业界的广泛关注。随着ChatGPT等大语言模型（Large Language Models, LLMs）的出现，其在情感分析任务中的应用展现出巨大潜力。然而，现有LLMs在不同类型情感分析任务中的适用程度仍不明确。本文系统考察了LLMs执行各类情感分析任务的能力，涵盖传统情感分类、基于方面的情感分析以及主观文本的多维度分析。我们在26个数据集上对13项任务进行评估，并将结果与基于领域特定数据训练的小型语言模型（SLMs）进行对比。研究发现：LLMs在简单任务中表现良好，但在需要深度理解或结构化情感信息的复杂任务中表现欠佳；而在小样本学习场景下，LLMs显著优于SLMs，这表明其在标注资源有限时具有独特优势。同时，我们指出当前评估方法在衡量LLMs情感分析能力方面的局限性，并提出新型基准评估框架\textsc{SentiEval}以实现更全面、更贴近实际的评估。研究数据与代码已开源：\url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LLM-Sentiment}。
