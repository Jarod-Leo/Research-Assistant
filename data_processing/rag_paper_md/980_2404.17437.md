原文摘要:
Full waveform inversion (FWI) is used to reconstruct the physical properties
of subsurface media which plays an important role in seismic exploration.
However, the precision of FWI is seriously affected by the absence or
inaccuracy of low-frequency information. Therefore, reconstructing the
low-frequency signals accurately is highly significant in seismic data
processing. Low-frequency extrapolation of seismic records can be approached as
a deep learning regression problem. Thus, to obtain low-frequency information
from band-limited seismic records, a novel network structure called
low-frequency extrapolation transformer (LFET) is proposed to construct the
nonlinear mapping relationship between the data missing low-frequency and
low-frequency data in a supervised learning approach, which is inspired by the
transformer model widely used in natural language processing (NLP). We apply
multi-head self-attention (MSA) modules to model the remote dependencies of
seismic data. Based on this, we introduce a shifted window partitioning
approach to reduce the calculating amount. Due to the field data are not
suitable for supervised learning, we generate synthetic seismic records using
submodels selected from the benchmark Marmousi model as training data whose
characteristics are similar to that of the field data. A single trace of
synthetic band-limited seismic data in the time domain is used as the input
data, and the parameters of LFET are updated based on the errors between the
predicted trace and the corresponding label. The experimental results on the
data generated by different models, different wavelets, and different kinds of
field marine data demonstrate the feasibility and generalization of the
proposed method. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy with
lower computational expense than the traditional CNN method.

全波形反演（FWI）作为重建地下介质物性参数的重要方法，在地震勘探中具有关键作用。然而低频信息的缺失或失真会严重影响FWI的精度，因此准确重构低频信号对地震数据处理意义重大。本文将地震记录低频外推问题构建为深度学习回归任务，针对带限地震记录的低频信息获取需求，受自然语言处理中Transformer模型的启发，提出了一种新型低频外推Transformer网络（LFET），通过监督学习方式建立缺失低频数据与完整低频数据间的非线性映射关系。该网络采用多头自注意力（MSA）模块建模地震数据的远程依赖性，并引入移位窗口划分策略降低计算量。鉴于实际数据不适合监督学习，我们以Marmousi标准模型子集合成的具有实际数据特征的地震记录作为训练数据，以时域单道带限合成地震数据为输入，通过预测道与标签道的误差更新网络参数。在不同模型数据、不同子波及多类海上实际数据的测试结果表明，该方法具有可行性和强泛化能力，且较传统CNN方法以更低计算成本获得了更高精度。
