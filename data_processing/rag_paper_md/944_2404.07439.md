原文摘要:
Language models trained on internet-scale data sets have shown an impressive
ability to solve problems in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
However, experience is showing that these models are frequently brittle in
unexpected ways, and require significant scaffolding to ensure that they
operate correctly in the larger systems that comprise "language-model agents."
In this paper, we argue that behavior trees provide a unifying framework for
combining language models with classical AI and traditional programming. We
introduce Dendron, a Python library for programming language model agents using
behavior trees. We demonstrate the approach embodied by Dendron in three case
studies: building a chat agent, a camera-based infrastructure inspection agent
for use on a mobile robot or vehicle, and an agent that has been built to
satisfy safety constraints that it did not receive through instruction tuning
or RLHF.

基于互联网规模数据集训练的语言模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域展现出了卓越的问题解决能力。然而实践表明，这些模型往往存在意想不到的脆弱性，需要构建大量辅助框架才能确保其在构成"语言模型智能体"的复杂系统中正确运行。本文提出行为树可为语言模型与传统人工智能及编程方法的融合提供统一框架，并介绍了基于Python的行为树编程库Dendron。通过三个案例研究，我们展示了Dendron的实现方法：构建聊天机器人、开发用于移动机器人/车辆的基于摄像头的基础设施检测智能体，以及创建能自主满足未通过指令调优或强化学习反馈获得的安全约束条件的智能体。
