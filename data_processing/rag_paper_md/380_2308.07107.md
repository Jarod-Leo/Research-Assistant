# Large Language Models for Information Retrieval: A Survey

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07107v2

原文摘要:
As a primary means of information acquisition, information retrieval (IR)
systems, such as search engines, have integrated themselves into our daily
lives. These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering,
and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its
origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models.
While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and
semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face
challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of
contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution
requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse
retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as
language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the
emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has
revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language
understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities.
Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR
systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary
to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a
comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs
and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers,
rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions, such as
search agents, within this expanding field.

作为信息获取的主要手段，搜索引擎等信息检索（IR）系统已深度融入日常生活，并成为对话系统、问答系统及推荐系统的核心组件。信息检索技术经历了从基于术语的传统方法到与先进神经模型融合的动态演进。尽管神经模型擅长捕捉复杂上下文信号与语义细微差异，从而重塑了信息检索范式，但仍面临数据稀缺性、可解释性以及可能生成语境合理但不准确响应等挑战。这一发展路径要求将传统方法（如响应迅速的基于术语稀疏检索）与现代神经架构（如具备强大语言理解能力的语言模型）有机结合。与此同时，以ChatGPT和GPT-4为代表的大语言模型（LLMs）凭借卓越的语言理解、生成、泛化与推理能力，彻底改变了自然语言处理领域。因此，近期研究致力于利用LLMs优化信息检索系统。鉴于该研究领域的快速演进，亟需整合现有方法论并通过系统综述提供深度洞察。本文深入探讨LLMs与信息检索系统的融合，涵盖查询重写器、检索器、重排序器和阅读器等关键组件，同时展望了搜索智能体等这一扩展领域中的前沿方向。
