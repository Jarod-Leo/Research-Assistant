# Large Language Models on Lexical Semantic Change Detection: An Evaluation

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06002v1

原文摘要:
Lexical Semantic Change Detection stands out as one of the few areas where
Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been extensively involved. Traditional
methods like PPMI, and SGNS remain prevalent in research, alongside newer
BERT-based approaches. Despite the comprehensive coverage of various natural
language processing domains by LLMs, there is a notable scarcity of literature
concerning their application in this specific realm. In this work, we seek to
bridge this gap by introducing LLMs into the domain of Lexical Semantic Change
Detection. Our work presents novel prompting solutions and a comprehensive
evaluation that spans all three generations of language models, contributing to
the exploration of LLMs in this research area.

词汇语义演变检测是大型语言模型（LLMs）尚未广泛涉足的少数领域之一。传统方法如PPMI和SGNS在研究中仍占主导地位，同时基于BERT的新方法也逐渐兴起。尽管LLMs已全面覆盖自然语言处理的多个领域，但关于其在该特定领域应用的文献却明显匮乏。本研究旨在通过将LLMs引入词汇语义演变检测领域来弥合这一空白。我们提出了创新的提示解决方案，并对三代语言模型进行了全面评估，为探索LLMs在该研究领域的应用做出了贡献。
