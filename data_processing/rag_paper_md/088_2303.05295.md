# Dynamic Stashing Quantization for Efficient Transformer Training

原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Unfortunately, the immense
amount of computations and memory accesses required for LLM training makes them
prohibitively expensive in terms of hardware cost, and thus challenging to
deploy in use cases such as on-device learning. In this paper, motivated by the
observation that LLM training is memory-bound, we propose a novel dynamic
quantization strategy, termed Dynamic Stashing Quantization (DSQ), that puts a
special focus on reducing the memory operations, but also enjoys the other
benefits of low precision training, such as the reduced arithmetic cost. We
conduct a thorough study on two translation tasks (trained-from-scratch) and
three classification tasks (fine-tuning). DSQ reduces the amount of arithmetic
operations by $20.95\times$ and the number of DRAM operations by $2.55\times$
on IWSLT17 compared to the standard 16-bit fixed-point, which is widely used in
on-device learning.
