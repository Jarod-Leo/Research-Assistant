原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable attention as they
are capable of showcasing impressive capabilities generating comparable
high-quality responses to human inputs. LLMs, can not only compose textual
scripts such as emails and essays but also executable programming code.
Contrary, the automated reasoning capability of these LLMs in performing
statistically-driven descriptive analysis, particularly on user-specific data
and as personal assistants to users with limited background knowledge in an
application domain who would like to carry out basic, as well as advanced
statistical and domain-specific analysis is not yet fully explored. More
importantly, the performance of these LLMs has not been compared and discussed
in detail when domain-specific data analysis tasks are needed. This study,
consequently, explores whether LLMs can be used as generative AI-based personal
assistants to users with minimal background knowledge in an application domain
infer key data insights. To demonstrate the performance of the LLMs, the study
reports a case study through which descriptive statistical analysis, as well as
Natural Language Processing (NLP) based investigations, are performed on a
number of phishing emails with the objective of comparing the accuracy of the
results generated by LLMs to the ones produced by analysts. The experimental
results show that LangChain and the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4)
excel in numerical reasoning tasks i.e., temporal statistical analysis, achieve
competitive correlation with human judgments on feature engineering tasks while
struggle to some extent on domain specific knowledge reasoning, where
domain-specific knowledge is required.

大型语言模型（LLMs）因其能够针对人类输入生成媲美高质量回应的卓越能力而备受关注。它们不仅能撰写电子邮件、论文等文本脚本，还可生成可执行程序代码。然而，这些模型在统计驱动的描述性分析中的自动推理能力——特别是针对用户特定数据时，以及作为应用领域背景知识有限的用户的个人助手（这些用户希望进行基础或高级的统计及领域特定分析）——尚未得到充分探索。更重要的是，当涉及领域特定的数据分析任务时，这些模型的性能尚未被详细比较与讨论。

为此，本研究探讨了LLMs能否作为基于生成式AI的个人助手，帮助应用领域背景知识有限的用户推断关键数据洞见。为验证模型性能，研究通过案例展示了针对多封钓鱼邮件进行的描述性统计分析和基于自然语言处理（NLP）的检测，旨在对比LLMs生成结果与分析人员所得结果的准确性。实验结果表明：LangChain和生成式预训练变换模型（GPT-4）在数值推理任务（如时序统计分析）中表现优异，在特征工程任务上达到与人类判断相当的关联性，但在需要领域专业知识的特定领域知识推理方面仍存在一定局限。
