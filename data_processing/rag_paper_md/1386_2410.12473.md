# Unifying Economic and Language Models for Enhanced Sentiment Analysis of the Oil Market

原文摘要:
Crude oil, a critical component of the global economy, has its prices
influenced by various factors such as economic trends, political events, and
natural disasters. Traditional prediction methods based on historical data have
their limits in forecasting, but recent advancements in natural language
processing bring new possibilities for event-based analysis. In particular,
Language Models (LM) and their advancement, the Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (GPT), have shown potential in classifying vast amounts of natural
language. However, these LMs often have difficulty with domain-specific
terminology, limiting their effectiveness in the crude oil sector. Addressing
this gap, we introduce CrudeBERT, a fine-tuned LM specifically for the crude
oil market. The results indicate that CrudeBERT's sentiment scores align more
closely with the WTI Futures curve and significantly enhance price predictions,
underscoring the crucial role of integrating economic principles into LMs.

原油作为全球经济的重要组成部分，其价格走势深受经济趋势、政治事件和自然灾害等多重因素影响。传统基于历史数据的预测方法存在局限性，而自然语言处理技术的最新进展为事件驱动分析提供了新思路。以语言模型（LM）及其进阶版本生成式预训练变换器（GPT）为代表的技术，在海量自然语言分类任务中展现出潜力。然而这些通用模型对原油领域专业术语的处理能力不足，制约了其在该领域的应用效果。为此，我们提出了专为原油市场优化的微调模型CrudeBERT。实证结果表明，该模型生成的情绪指标与WTI期货曲线呈现更高契合度，并能显著提升价格预测精度，这印证了将经济学原理融入语言模型的关键价值。
