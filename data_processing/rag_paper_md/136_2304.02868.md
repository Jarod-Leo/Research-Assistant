# Can Large Language Models Play Text Games Well? Current State-of-the-Art and Open Questions

原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently
demonstrated their remarkable abilities of communicating with human users. In
this technical report, we take an initiative to investigate their capacities of
playing text games, in which a player has to understand the environment and
respond to situations by having dialogues with the game world. Our experiments
show that ChatGPT performs competitively compared to all the existing systems
but still exhibits a low level of intelligence. Precisely, ChatGPT can not
construct the world model by playing the game or even reading the game manual;
it may fail to leverage the world knowledge that it already has; it cannot
infer the goal of each step as the game progresses. Our results open up new
research questions at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and natural language processing.

以ChatGPT和GPT-4为代表的大语言模型近期展现出与人类用户对话的卓越能力。本技术报告率先探究此类模型在文本游戏中的表现——这类游戏要求玩家通过与环境对话来理解情境并作出响应。实验表明，ChatGPT虽优于现有系统，但智能水平仍有限：它无法通过游戏过程或阅读手册构建世界模型；难以有效利用已掌握的世界知识；且无法随游戏进程推断分阶段目标。这一发现为人工智能、机器学习与自然语言处理的交叉领域提出了新的研究命题。
