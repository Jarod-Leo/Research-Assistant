原文摘要:
Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering has been
a crucial step for eliciting desired responses for various Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. However, prompt engineering remains an impediment for
end users due to rapid advances in models, tasks, and associated best
practices. To mitigate this, Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) techniques
have recently emerged that use various automated techniques to help improve the
performance of LLMs on various tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
survey summarizing the current progress and remaining challenges in this field.
We provide a formal definition of APO, a 5-part unifying framework, and then
proceed to rigorously categorize all relevant works based on their salient
features therein. We hope to spur further research guided by our framework.

自大语言模型（LLMs）问世以来，提示工程始终是激发各类自然语言处理（NLP）任务预期响应的关键环节。然而，由于模型、任务及相关最佳实践的快速迭代，提示工程仍是终端用户面临的主要障碍。为此，自动提示优化（APO）技术应运而生，通过多种自动化手段提升大模型在各类任务中的表现。本文系统梳理了该领域的研究进展与现存挑战：首先给出APO的正式定义与五维统一框架，继而依据核心特征对所有相关研究进行严格分类。我们期望这一框架能为后续研究提供方向性指引。
