# SmartFlow: Robotic Process Automation using LLMs

原文摘要:
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems face challenges in handling complex
processes and diverse screen layouts that require advanced human-like
decision-making capabilities. These systems typically rely on pixel-level
encoding through drag-and-drop or automation frameworks such as Selenium to
create navigation workflows, rather than visual understanding of screen
elements. In this context, we present SmartFlow, an AI-based RPA system that
uses pre-trained large language models (LLMs) coupled with deep-learning based
image understanding. Our system can adapt to new scenarios, including changes
in the user interface and variations in input data, without the need for human
intervention. SmartFlow uses computer vision and natural language processing to
perceive visible elements on the graphical user interface (GUI) and convert
them into a textual representation. This information is then utilized by LLMs
to generate a sequence of actions that are executed by a scripting engine to
complete an assigned task. To assess the effectiveness of SmartFlow, we have
developed a dataset that includes a set of generic enterprise applications with
diverse layouts, which we are releasing for research use. Our evaluations on
this dataset demonstrate that SmartFlow exhibits robustness across different
layouts and applications. SmartFlow can automate a wide range of business
processes such as form filling, customer service, invoice processing, and
back-office operations. SmartFlow can thus assist organizations in enhancing
productivity by automating an even larger fraction of screen-based workflows.

机器人流程自动化（RPA）系统在处理需要类人高级决策能力的复杂流程和多样化屏幕布局时面临挑战。现有系统通常依赖基于像素级编码的拖拽操作或Selenium等自动化框架来创建导航工作流，而非通过视觉理解屏幕元素。为此，我们推出SmartFlow——一个基于人工智能的RPA系统，它结合预训练大语言模型（LLM）与深度学习图像理解技术。该系统能自适应新场景（包括用户界面变更和输入数据变化），无需人工干预。

SmartFlow运用计算机视觉和自然语言处理技术感知图形用户界面（GUI）上的可视元素，并将其转换为文本表征。随后LLM利用这些信息生成动作序列，由脚本引擎执行以完成任务。为评估系统效能，我们构建了包含多种布局的通用企业应用程序数据集并公开供研究使用。测试表明，SmartFlow在不同布局和应用中均表现出强健性，可自动化表单填写、客户服务、发票处理及后台运营等广泛业务流程，助力企业通过自动化更多基于屏幕的工作流提升生产效率。演示视频及数据集详见https://smartflow-4c5a0a.webflow.io/。
