原文摘要:
Deep generative models for molecular discovery have become a very popular
choice in new high-throughput screening paradigms. These models have been
developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and
computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular
modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity,
interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable
molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative
models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an
autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of
discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a
'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the
chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of
a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and
the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be
a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a
multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the
target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility.
Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation
distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.

深度生成模型在分子发现领域已成为新型高通量筛选范式中备受青睐的工具。这类模型借鉴了自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域的技术突破，不断取得更优异的性能表现。然而，分子生成建模存在若干独特挑战常被忽视：化学结构有效性、生成过程可解释性以及对可变分子尺寸的适应性，这些仍是计算材料设计中生成模型亟待解决的难题。本研究提出一种自回归方法，将分子生成解构为以分子片段为单位的离散可解释步骤序列——即"分子故事"。通过强制故事遵循化学规则确保生成分子的化学有效性，离散化的序列步骤使过程透明化提升可解释性，而方法的自回归特性则使分子尺寸成为模型的自主决策。我们在电活性有机化合物的多目标逆向设计中验证了该方法的有效性，重点关注溶解度、氧化还原电位和合成可行性等目标属性。实验结果表明，该模型能根据指定的多目标要求有效偏置生成分布。
