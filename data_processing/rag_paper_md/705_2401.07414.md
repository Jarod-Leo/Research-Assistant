# Leveraging the power of transformers for guilt detection in text

原文摘要:
In recent years, language models and deep learning techniques have
revolutionized natural language processing tasks, including emotion detection.
However, the specific emotion of guilt has received limited attention in this
field. In this research, we explore the applicability of three
transformer-based language models for detecting guilt in text and compare their
performance for general emotion detection and guilt detection. Our proposed
model outformed BERT and RoBERTa models by two and one points respectively.
Additionally, we analyze the challenges in developing accurate guilt-detection
models and evaluate our model's effectiveness in detecting related emotions
like "shame" through qualitative analysis of results.

近年来，语言模型与深度学习技术彻底改变了包括情感检测在内的自然语言处理任务。然而在具体情感维度上，内疚情绪的研究尚未得到足够重视。本研究探索了三种基于Transformer架构的语言模型在文本内疚情绪检测中的适用性，并对比了它们在通用情感检测与内疚专项检测中的表现。我们提出的模型以2分和1分的优势分别超越了BERT与RoBERTa基准模型。此外，研究还剖析了构建精准内疚检测模型面临的挑战，通过对结果的定性分析评估了模型在"羞愧"等关联情绪上的检测效能。
