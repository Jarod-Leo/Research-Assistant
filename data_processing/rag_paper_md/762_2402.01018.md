原文摘要:
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reshaping
Natural Language Processing (NLP) task in several domains. Their use in the
field of Human Resources (HR) has still room for expansions and could be
beneficial for several time consuming tasks. Examples such as time-off
submissions, medical claims filing, and access requests are noteworthy, but
they are by no means the sole instances. However, the aforementioned
developments must grapple with the pivotal challenge of constructing a
high-quality training dataset. On one hand, most conversation datasets are
solving problems for customers not employees. On the other hand, gathering
conversations with HR could raise privacy concerns. To solve it, we introduce
HR-Multiwoz, a fully-labeled dataset of 550 conversations spanning 10 HR
domains to evaluate LLM Agent. Our work has the following contributions: (1) It
is the first labeled open-sourced conversation dataset in the HR domain for NLP
research. (2) It provides a detailed recipe for the data generation procedure
along with data analysis and human evaluations. The data generation pipeline is
transferable and can be easily adapted for labeled conversation data generation
in other domains. (3) The proposed data-collection pipeline is mostly based on
LLMs with minimal human involvement for annotation, which is time and
cost-efficient.

近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）的突破性进展正重塑多个领域的自然语言处理（NLP）任务。其在人力资源（HR）领域的应用仍有拓展空间，尤其适用于优化各类耗时流程，如休假申请、医疗报销提交和权限请求等——这些仅是众多潜在场景中的部分示例。然而，上述发展必须应对构建高质量训练数据集这一核心挑战：一方面，现有对话数据集多面向客户服务而非员工需求；另一方面，收集人力资源对话可能引发隐私问题。为此，我们推出HR-Multiwoz数据集，包含10个HR细分领域的550段全标注对话，专为评估LLM智能体而设计。本研究的贡献在于：（1）首次发布面向NLP研究的开源HR领域标注对话数据集；（2）详细公开数据生成方法流程，辅以数据分析和人工评估，该流程具有可迁移性，可快速适配其他领域的标注对话生成；（3）提出的数据收集方案主要基于LLMs实现，仅需极少量人工标注介入，显著提升了时间与经济效率。
