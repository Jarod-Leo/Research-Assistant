原文摘要:
Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as
ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their
exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data
understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has
driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless
networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while
these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application
scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication
systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization,
and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital
infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed
inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing
environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper
exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent
advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges
and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs,
focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential
solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two
fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions.
Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their
societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for
next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey
provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and
wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to
drive innovations.
