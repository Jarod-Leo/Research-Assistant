原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in the field
of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating remarkable abilities in
producing text that resembles human language for various tasks. This opens up
new opportunities for employing them in recommender systems (RSs). In this
paper, we specifically examine the sample efficiency of LLM-enhanced
recommender systems, which pertains to the model's capacity to attain superior
performance with a limited quantity of training data. Conventional
recommendation models (CRMs) often need a large amount of training data because
of the sparsity of features and interactions. Hence, we propose and verify our
core viewpoint: Large Language Models Make Sample-Efficient Recommender
Systems. We propose a simple yet effective framework (i.e., Laser) to validate
the viewpoint from two aspects: (1) LLMs themselves are sample-efficient
recommenders; and (2) LLMs, as feature generators and encoders, make CRMs more
sample-efficient. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that Laser
requires only a small fraction of training samples to match or even surpass
CRMs that are trained on the entire training set, demonstrating superior sample
efficiency.

大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）领域取得了显著进展，展现出为各类任务生成类人文本的卓越能力。这为将其应用于推荐系统（RSs）开辟了新机遇。本文重点研究了LLM增强推荐系统的样本效率问题，即模型在有限训练数据下实现优异性能的能力。传统推荐模型（CRMs）由于特征与交互的稀疏性，通常需要大量训练数据支撑。因此，我们提出并验证核心观点：大语言模型能构建样本高效的推荐系统。通过设计简单而有效的框架Laser，我们从两个维度验证该观点：(1) LLMs本身即具备样本高效的推荐能力；(2) LLMs作为特征生成器与编码器，可显著提升CRMs的样本效率。在两个公开数据集上的大量实验表明，Laser仅需极小比例的训练样本即可匹配甚至超越在全量训练集上训练的CRMs，展现出卓越的样本效率优势。
