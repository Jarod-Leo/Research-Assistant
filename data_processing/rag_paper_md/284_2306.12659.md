原文摘要:
Sentiment analysis is a vital tool for uncovering insights from financial
articles, news, and social media, shaping our understanding of market
movements. Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
in financial natural language processing (NLP), they still struggle with
accurately interpreting numerical values and grasping financial context,
limiting their effectiveness in predicting financial sentiment. In this paper,
we introduce a simple yet effective instruction tuning approach to address
these issues. By transforming a small portion of supervised financial sentiment
analysis data into instruction data and fine-tuning a general-purpose LLM with
this method, we achieve remarkable advancements in financial sentiment
analysis. In the experiment, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
supervised sentiment analysis models, as well as widely used LLMs like ChatGPT
and LLaMAs, particularly in scenarios where numerical understanding and
contextual comprehension are vital.

情感分析是从金融文章、新闻及社交媒体中挖掘市场动向认知的重要工具。尽管大语言模型在金融自然语言处理领域展现出卓越能力，但其在数值精准解读与金融语境理解方面仍存在局限，制约了金融情感预测的实效性。本文提出一种简洁高效的指令微调方法：通过将少量监督式金融情感分析数据转化为指令数据，并以此微调通用大语言模型，实现了该领域的显著突破。实验表明，我们的方法在数值敏感和语境依赖场景中，不仅超越了当前最先进的监督式情感分析模型，更显著优于ChatGPT、LLaMAs等主流大语言模型。
