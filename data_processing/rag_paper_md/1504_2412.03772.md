原文摘要:
With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), which possess
powerful natural language processing and generation capabilities, LLMs are
poised to provide more natural and personalized user experiences. Their
deployment on mobile devices is gradually becoming a significant trend in the
field of intelligent devices. LLMs have demonstrated tremendous potential in
applications such as voice assistants, real-time translation, and intelligent
recommendations. Advancements in hardware technologies (such as neural network
accelerators) and network infrastructure (such as 5G) have enabled efficient
local inference and low-latency intelligent responses on mobile devices. This
reduces reliance on cloud computing while enhancing data privacy and security.
Developers can easily integrate LLM functionalities through open APIs and SDKs,
enabling the creation of more innovative intelligent applications. The
widespread use of LLMs not only enhances the intelligence of mobile devices but
also fosters the integrated innovation of fields like augmented reality (AR)
and the Internet of Things (IoT). This trend is expected to drive the
development of the next generation of mobile intelligent applications.
