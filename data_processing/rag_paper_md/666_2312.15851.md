# Hypergraph Enhanced Knowledge Tree Prompt Learning for Next-Basket Recommendation

原文摘要:
Next-basket recommendation (NBR) aims to infer the items in the next basket
given the corresponding basket sequence. Existing NBR methods are mainly based
on either message passing in a plain graph or transition modelling in a basket
sequence. However, these methods only consider point-to-point binary item
relations while item dependencies in real world scenarios are often in higher
order. Additionally, the importance of the same item to different users varies
due to variation of user preferences, and the relations between items usually
involve various aspects. As pretrained language models (PLMs) excel in multiple
tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), many
researchers have made great efforts in utilizing PLMs to boost recommendation.
However, existing PLM-based recommendation methods degrade when encountering
Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) items. OOV items are those whose IDs are out of PLM's
vocabulary and thus unintelligible to PLM. To settle the above challenges, we
propose a novel method HEKP4NBR, which transforms the knowledge graph (KG) into
prompts, namely Knowledge Tree Prompt (KTP), to help PLM encode the OOV item
IDs in the user's basket sequence. A hypergraph convolutional module is
designed to build a hypergraph based on item similarities measured by an MoE
model from multiple aspects and then employ convolution on the hypergraph to
model correlations among multiple items. Extensive experiments are conducted on
HEKP4NBR on two datasets based on real company data and validate its
effectiveness against multiple state-of-the-art methods.

下一篮推荐（NBR）旨在根据给定的购物篮序列推断下一次可能购买的商品。现有NBR方法主要基于平面图中的消息传递或购物篮序列中的转移建模，但这些方法仅考虑点对点的二元商品关系，而现实场景中的商品依赖往往呈现更高阶特性。此外，由于用户偏好的差异性，同一商品对不同用户的重要性存在显著差异，且商品间关联通常涉及多维度特征。尽管预训练语言模型（PLM）在自然语言处理（NLP）和计算机视觉（CV）领域表现卓越，现有基于PLM的推荐方法在遇到词汇表外（OOV）商品时性能显著下降——这些商品的ID因超出PLM词汇表范围而无法被模型识别。

针对上述挑战，本文提出创新方法HEKP4NBR：通过将知识图谱（KG）转化为提示模板（即知识树提示KTP），辅助PLM对用户购物篮序列中的OOV商品ID进行编码。该方法设计超图卷积模块，基于混合专家（MoE）模型从多维度衡量的商品相似度构建超图，并通过超图卷积建模多商品间的复杂关联。基于真实企业数据的双数据集实验表明，HEKP4NBR在多项指标上显著优于当前最先进方法，验证了其有效性。
