原文摘要:
Diagnosing language disorders associated with autism is a complex challenge,
often hampered by the subjective nature and variability of traditional
assessment methods. Traditional diagnostic methods not only require intensive
human effort but also often result in delayed interventions due to their lack
of speed and precision. In this study, we explored the application of ChatGPT,
a large language model, to overcome these obstacles by enhancing sensitivity
and profiling linguistic features for autism diagnosis. This research utilizes
ChatGPT natural language processing capabilities to simplify and improve the
diagnostic process, focusing on identifying autism related language patterns.
Specifically, we compared ChatGPT performance with that of conventional
supervised learning models, including BERT, a model acclaimed for its
effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We showed that
ChatGPT substantially outperformed these models, achieving over 10% improvement
in both sensitivity and positive predictive value, in a zero shot learning
configuration. The findings underscore the model potential as a diagnostic
tool, combining accuracy and applicability. We identified ten key features of
autism associated language disorders across scenarios. Features such as
echolalia, pronoun reversal, and atypical language usage play a critical role
in diagnosing ASD and informing tailored treatment plans. Together, our
findings advocate for adopting sophisticated AI tools like ChatGPT in clinical
settings to assess and diagnose developmental disorders. Our approach promises
enhanced diagnostic precision and supports personalized medicine, potentially
transforming the evaluation landscape for autism and similar neurological
conditions.

诊断与自闭症相关的语言障碍是一项复杂的挑战，传统评估方法的主观性和多变性往往制约着诊断效果。这些传统方法不仅需要耗费大量人力，且因缺乏速度与精确性常导致干预措施延迟。本研究探索了如何运用大语言模型ChatGPT来突破这些障碍——通过提升诊断敏感性和构建自闭症语言特征画像。我们利用ChatGPT的自然语言处理能力简化和优化诊断流程，重点识别自闭症相关语言模式。

具体而言，我们将ChatGPT与传统监督学习模型（包括在多项自然语言处理任务中表现卓越的BERT模型）进行性能对比。研究表明，在零样本学习配置下，ChatGPT的敏感度和阳性预测值均显著超越基线模型10%以上。这些发现印证了该模型兼具准确性与适用性的诊断工具潜力。我们最终确定了自闭症语言障碍的十大关键特征，其中回声性语言、代词错位和非典型语言使用等特征对自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）的诊断及个性化治疗方案的制定具有决定性作用。

本研究主张在临床环境中采用ChatGPT等先进AI工具来评估发育障碍。我们的方法不仅能提高诊断精确度，还可支持个性化医疗，有望彻底改变自闭症及类似神经发育疾病的评估范式。
