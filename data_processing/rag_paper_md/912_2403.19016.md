原文摘要:
In the upcoming 6G era, vehicular networks are shifting from simple
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to the more complex
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity. At the forefront of this shift is the
incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into vehicles. Known for their
sophisticated natural language processing abilities, LLMs change how users
interact with their vehicles. This integration facilitates voice-driven
commands and interactions, departing from the conventional manual control
systems. However, integrating LLMs into vehicular systems presents notable
challenges. The substantial computational demands and energy requirements of
LLMs pose significant challenges, especially in the constrained environment of
a vehicle. Additionally, the time-sensitive nature of tasks in vehicular
networks adds another layer of complexity. In this paper, we consider an edge
computing system where vehicles process the initial layers of LLM computations
locally, and offload the remaining LLM computation tasks to the Roadside Units
(RSUs), envisioning a vehicular ecosystem where LLM computations seamlessly
interact with the ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth capabilities of 6G
networks. To balance the trade-off between completion time and energy
consumption, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize
the total cost of the vehicles and RSUs. The problem is then decomposed into
two sub-problems, which are solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP)
method and fractional programming technique. The simulation results clearly
indicate that the algorithm we have proposed is highly effective in reducing
both the completion time and energy consumption of the system.

在即将到来的6G时代，车载网络正从简单的车对车（V2V）通信向更复杂的车联万物（V2X）连接转变。这一变革的前沿是将大语言模型（LLM）整合到车辆中。凭借其先进的自然语言处理能力，LLM彻底改变了用户与车辆的交互方式，推动语音指令交互系统逐步取代传统手动控制系统。然而，LLM与车载系统的融合面临着显著挑战：庞大的计算需求和能耗压力在车辆有限的环境中尤为突出，加之车载网络任务对时效性的严苛要求，进一步增加了系统复杂性。本文提出一种边缘计算架构——车辆本地处理LLM初始计算层，剩余计算任务卸载至路侧单元（RSU），构建LLM计算与6G超低时延、高带宽特性无缝协同的车载生态系统。为权衡任务完成时间与能耗，我们建立多目标优化问题以最小化车辆与RSU的总成本，并通过序列二次规划（SQP）和分式规划技术分解求解两个子问题。仿真结果充分证明，所提算法能显著降低系统时延与能耗。
