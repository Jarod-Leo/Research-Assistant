原文摘要:
The use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in engineering
education can provide valuable insights into the underlying processes involved
in generating text. While accessing these insights can be labor-intensive if
done manually, recent advances in NLP and large language models have made it a
realistic option for individuals. This study explores and evaluates a
combination of clustering, summarization, and prompting techniques to analyze
over 1,000 student essays in which students discussed their career interests.
The specific assignment prompted students to define and explain their career
goals as engineers. Using text embedding representations of student responses,
we clustered the responses together to identify thematically similar statements
from students. The clustered responses were then summarized to quickly identify
career interest themes. We also used a set of a priori codes about career
satisfaction and sectors to demonstrate an alternative approach to using these
generative text models to analyze student writing. The results of this study
demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of NLP techniques in engineering
education research. By automating the initial analysis of student essays,
researchers and educators can more efficiently and accurately identify key
themes and patterns in student writing. The methods presented in this paper
have broader applications for engineering education and research purposes
beyond analyzing student essays. By explaining these methods to the engineering
education community, readers can utilize them in their own contexts.
