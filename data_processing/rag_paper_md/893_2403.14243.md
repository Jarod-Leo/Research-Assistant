原文摘要:
The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates great promise in the field of
medical discovery, diagnostics and patient management. However, the vast
complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines
machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately,
large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an
Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the
diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of
dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this
domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models
and sophisticated machine learning tools. This holistic approach achieves a
nuanced interpretation of dermatological conditions that simulates and
facilitates a dermatologist's workflow. We assess our proposed methodology
through a thorough cross-model validation technique embedded in an evaluation
pipeline that utilizes publicly available medical case studies of skin
conditions and relevant images. To quantitatively score the system performance,
advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools are employed
which focus on similarity comparison and natural language inference.
Additionally, we incorporate a human expert evaluation process based on a
structured checklist to further validate our results. We implemented the
proposed methodology in a system which achieved approximate (weighted) scores
of 0.87 for both contextual understanding and diagnostic accuracy,
demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing dermatological
analysis. The proposed methodology is expected to prove useful in the
development of next-generation tele-dermatology applications, enhancing remote
consultation capabilities and access to care, especially in underserved areas.

人工智能的崛起为医学发现、诊断及患者管理领域带来了巨大前景。然而，所有医学领域的极端复杂性需要一种融合机器学习算法、分类器、分割算法以及近期大型语言模型的综合方法。本文提出并评估了一套人工智能赋能的系统与方法论，旨在全面支持皮肤病学领域中皮肤病变及其他皮肤状况的诊断流程。该工作流整合了基于Transformer架构的大型语言模型、视觉模型以及先进的机器学习工具，通过模拟皮肤科医生工作模式实现了对皮肤病症的精细化解读。

我们采用嵌套在评估管道中的跨模型验证技术对方法论进行系统检验，该管道利用了公开的皮肤病医学案例研究及相关图像。为量化系统性能，研究采用了聚焦语义相似度比较与自然语言推理的机器学习及自然语言处理工具。此外，我们还引入了基于结构化清单的人类专家评估流程以进一步验证结果。在实现系统中，该方法论在上下文理解（0.87加权分）和诊断准确性（0.87加权分）方面均表现出色，证实了其在提升皮肤病学分析效能方面的优势。

这项研究预期将推动新一代远程皮肤病学应用的发展，特别是在医疗资源匮乏地区，通过增强远程会诊能力来改善医疗服务可及性。
