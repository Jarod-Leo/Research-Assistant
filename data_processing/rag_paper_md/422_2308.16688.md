原文摘要:
Purpose: In this paper, we present an automated method for article
classification, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLM). The
primary focus is on the field of ophthalmology, but the model is extendable to
other fields. Methods: We have developed a model based on Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques, including advanced LLMs, to process and analyze
the textual content of scientific papers. Specifically, we have employed
zero-shot learning (ZSL) LLM models and compared against Bidirectional and
Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and its variants, and Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT), and its variant such as distilBERT,
SciBERT, PubmedBERT, BioBERT. Results: The classification results demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLMs in categorizing large number of ophthalmology papers
without human intervention. Results: To evalute the LLMs, we compiled a dataset
(RenD) of 1000 ocular disease-related articles, which were expertly annotated
by a panel of six specialists into 15 distinct categories. The model achieved
mean accuracy of 0.86 and mean F1 of 0.85 based on the RenD dataset.
Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves notable improvements in both
accuracy and efficiency. Its application in the domain of ophthalmology
showcases its potential for knowledge organization and retrieval in other
domains too. We performed trend analysis that enables the researchers and
clinicians to easily categorize and retrieve relevant papers, saving time and
effort in literature review and information gathering as well as identification
of emerging scientific trends within different disciplines. Moreover, the
extendibility of the model to other scientific fields broadens its impact in
facilitating research and trend analysis across diverse disciplines.

目的：本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）实现论文自动分类的方法。该方法以眼科领域为主要研究对象，但模型可扩展至其他学科领域。方法：我们基于自然语言处理（NLP）技术开发了分类模型，通过整合先进的大型语言模型对科学论文文本内容进行处理与分析。具体采用零样本学习（ZSL）LLM模型，并与双向自回归变换器（BART）及其变体、双向编码器表示变换器（BERT）及其衍生模型（如distilBERT、SciBERT、PubmedBERT、BioBERT）进行性能对比。结果：基于构建的RenD数据集（包含1000篇经六位专家标注的眼科疾病文献，分为15个类别），模型取得平均准确率0.86和平均F1值0.85，证实了LLM在无需人工干预情况下对海量眼科文献进行有效分类的能力。结论：该框架在准确性与效率方面均有显著提升，其在眼科领域的应用展示了跨学科知识组织与检索的潜力。通过趋势分析功能，可帮助研究人员快速归类检索文献，节省文献调研时间，并识别不同学科的新兴科研趋势。模型的可扩展性将进一步促进跨学科研究与趋势分析的发展。
