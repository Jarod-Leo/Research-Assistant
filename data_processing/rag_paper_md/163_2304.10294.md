# OptoGPT: A Foundation Model for Inverse Design in Optical Multilayer Thin Film Structures

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10294v1

原文摘要:
Optical multilayer thin film structures have been widely used in numerous
photonic applications. However, existing inverse design methods have many
drawbacks because they either fail to quickly adapt to different design
targets, or are difficult to suit for different types of structures, e.g.,
designing for different materials at each layer. These methods also cannot
accommodate versatile design situations under different angles and
polarizations. In addition, how to benefit practical fabrications and
manufacturing has not been extensively considered yet. In this work, we
introduce OptoGPT (Opto Generative Pretrained Transformer), a decoder-only
transformer, to solve all these drawbacks and issues simultaneously.

光学多层薄膜结构已广泛应用于众多光子学领域。然而，现有逆向设计方法存在诸多缺陷：它们要么难以快速适应不同设计目标，要么无法兼容各类结构类型（例如要求逐层设计不同材料）。这些方法亦难以应对多角度、多偏振态等多样化设计场景。此外，如何服务于实际制备工艺的问题尚未得到充分考量。本研究提出的OptoGPT（光学生成预训练变换器）作为一种仅含解码器的变换器模型，可同步解决上述所有问题。
