原文摘要:
The surge of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the extraction
and analysis of crucial information from a growing volume of financial
statements, announcements, and business news. Recognition for named entities to
construct structured data poses a significant challenge in analyzing financial
documents and is a foundational task for intelligent financial analytics.
However, how effective are these generic LLMs and their performance under
various prompts are yet need a better understanding. To fill in the blank, we
present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting methods
in the financial Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. Specifically, our
experimental results highlight their strengths and limitations, identify five
representative failure types, and provide insights into their potential and
challenges for domain-specific tasks.

大型语言模型（LLM）的崛起彻底改变了从日益增长的财务报表、公告和商业新闻中提取与分析关键信息的方式。在金融文档分析中，命名实体识别（NER）作为构建结构化数据的基础任务，对实现智能金融分析至关重要，但其仍面临重大挑战。然而，这些通用LLM的实际效能及其在不同提示下的表现尚缺乏深入理解。为此，我们针对金融领域命名实体识别问题，对前沿LLM及提示方法进行了系统性评估。实验结果表明：模型在特定场景下展现出优势，同时暴露出五类典型错误模式，为领域专用任务的潜力与挑战提供了实证依据。
