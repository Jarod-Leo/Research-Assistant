原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
language understanding and generation. Advanced utilization of the knowledge
embedded in LLMs for automated annotation has consistently been explored. This
study proposed to develop an emotion lexicon for Cantonese, a low-resource
language, through collaborative efforts between LLM and human annotators. By
integrating emotion labels provided by LLM and human annotators, the study
leveraged existing linguistic resources including lexicons in other languages
and local forums to construct a Cantonese emotion lexicon enriched with
colloquial expressions. The consistency of the proposed emotion lexicon in
emotion extraction was assessed through modification and utilization of three
distinct emotion text datasets. This study not only validates the efficacy of
the constructed lexicon but also emphasizes that collaborative annotation
between human and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the quality
of emotion labels, highlighting the potential of such partnerships in
facilitating natural language processing tasks for low-resource languages.

大型语言模型（LLM）在语言理解与生成方面展现出卓越能力，如何高效利用其内嵌知识实现自动化标注一直是研究热点。本研究提出通过LLM与人工标注者协作的方式，为资源稀缺的粤语构建情感词典。通过整合LLM提供的情感标签与人工标注结果，并融合多语言词典、本地论坛等现有语言资源，最终构建出包含丰富口语表达的粤语情感词典。研究通过修改并运用三种不同的情感文本数据集，评估了该词典在情感提取任务中的一致性表现。这项工作不仅验证了所构建词典的有效性，更揭示了人机协同标注能显著提升情感标签质量，为资源稀缺语言的自然语言处理任务提供了创新性的合作范式。
