# ParroT: Translating During Chat Using Large Language Models

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02426v2

原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have exhibited remarkable abilities
on a wide range of natural language processing~(NLP) tasks, including various
machine translation abilities accomplished during chat. However, these models
are only accessible through restricted APIs, which creates barriers to new
research and advancements in the field. Therefore, we propose ParroT, a
framework to enhance and regulate the translation abilities during chat based
on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA), human-written translation and feedback data.
Specifically, ParroT reformulates translation data into the
instruction-following style, and introduces a "$\mathbf{Hint}$" field for
incorporating extra requirements to regulate the translation process.
Accordingly, we propose three instruction types for finetuning ParroT models,
including translation instruction, contrastive instruction, and error-guided
instruction. Experiments on Flores subsets and WMT22 test sets suggest that
translation instruction improves the translation performance of vanilla LLMs
significantly while error-guided instruction can lead to further improvement,
which demonstrates the importance of learning from low-quality translations
annotated by humans. We also demonstrate the potential of automatic evaluation
tools in providing quality information of translations, when constructing
error-guided instructions for directions that lack human annotation data.

以ChatGPT为代表的大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）任务中展现出卓越能力，包括对话过程中实现的多种机器翻译功能。然而，这些模型仅能通过受限API访问，阻碍了该领域的新研究进展。为此，我们提出ParroT框架——基于开源LLMs（如LLaMA）、人工撰写译文及反馈数据，在对话场景中增强并调控翻译能力。具体而言，ParroT将翻译数据重构为指令跟随格式，并引入"提示"字段以整合额外需求来规范翻译过程。我们相应提出三种微调ParroT模型的指令类型：翻译指令、对比指令和错误引导指令。Flores子集与WMT22测试集的实验表明，翻译指令能显著提升基础LLMs的翻译性能，而错误引导指令可带来进一步改进，这印证了从人工标注低质量译文中学习的重要性。我们还验证了自动评估工具在构建缺乏人工标注方向的错误引导指令时，提供译文质量信息的潜力。更多实现细节请访问GitHub项目：https://github.com/wxjiao/ParroT
