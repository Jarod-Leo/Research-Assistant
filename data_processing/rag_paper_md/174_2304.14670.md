链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14670v1

原文摘要:
Prompt engineering is a critical technique in the field of natural language
processing that involves designing and optimizing the prompts used to input
information into models, aiming to enhance their performance on specific tasks.
With the recent advancements in large language models, prompt engineering has
shown significant superiority across various domains and has become
increasingly important in the healthcare domain. However, there is a lack of
comprehensive reviews specifically focusing on prompt engineering in the
medical field. This review will introduce the latest advances in prompt
engineering in the field of natural language processing for the medical field.
First, we will provide the development of prompt engineering and emphasize its
significant contributions to healthcare natural language processing
applications such as question-answering systems, text summarization, and
machine translation. With the continuous improvement of general large language
models, the importance of prompt engineering in the healthcare domain is
becoming increasingly prominent. The aim of this article is to provide useful
resources and bridges for healthcare natural language processing researchers to
better explore the application of prompt engineering in this field. We hope
that this review can provide new ideas and inspire for research and application
in medical natural language processing.
