# Lifelong Learning of Large Language Model based Agents: A Roadmap

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07278v1

原文摘要:
Lifelong learning, also known as continual or incremental learning, is a
crucial component for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by
enabling systems to continuously adapt in dynamic environments. While large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural
language processing, existing LLM agents are typically designed for static
systems and lack the ability to adapt over time in response to new challenges.
This survey is the first to systematically summarize the potential techniques
for incorporating lifelong learning into LLM-based agents. We categorize the
core components of these agents into three modules: the perception module for
multimodal input integration, the memory module for storing and retrieving
evolving knowledge, and the action module for grounded interactions with the
dynamic environment. We highlight how these pillars collectively enable
continuous adaptation, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and improve long-term
performance. This survey provides a roadmap for researchers and practitioners
working to develop lifelong learning capabilities in LLM agents, offering
insights into emerging trends, evaluation metrics, and application scenarios.

终身学习（又称持续学习或增量学习）是推动通用人工智能（AGI）发展的关键要素，它使系统能够在动态环境中持续适应。尽管大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理领域展现出卓越能力，但现有基于LLM的智能体通常针对静态系统设计，缺乏随时间推移应对新挑战的适应能力。本综述首次系统性地总结了将终身学习融入LLM智能体的潜在技术方案，将其核心组件划分为三大模块：负责多模态输入整合的感知模块、存储与检索动态知识的记忆模块，以及与动态环境进行具身交互的行动模块。我们着重阐释了这些模块如何协同实现持续适应能力，缓解灾难性遗忘问题，并提升长期性能表现。本综述为致力于开发LLM智能体终身学习能力的研究者与实践者提供了技术路线图，涵盖新兴趋势、评估指标和应用场景的深度分析。相关文献与资源详见\href{此链接}{https://github.com/qianlima-lab/awesome-lifelong-llm-agent}。
