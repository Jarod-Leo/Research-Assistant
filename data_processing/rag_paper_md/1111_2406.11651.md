原文摘要:
Dialogue state tracking (DST) is evaluated by exact matching methods, which
rely on large amounts of labeled data and ignore semantic consistency, leading
to over-evaluation. Currently, leveraging large language models (LLM) in
evaluating natural language processing tasks has achieved promising results.
However, using LLM for DST evaluation is still under explored. In this paper,
we propose a two-dimensional zero-shot evaluation method for DST using GPT-4,
which divides the evaluation into two dimensions: accuracy and completeness.
Furthermore, we also design two manual reasoning paths in prompting to further
improve the accuracy of evaluation. Experimental results show that our method
achieves better performance compared to the baselines, and is consistent with
traditional exact matching based methods.

对话状态追踪（DST）的评估通常采用精确匹配方法，这类方法依赖大量标注数据且忽视语义一致性，容易导致评估结果偏高。当前，利用大语言模型（LLM）评估自然语言处理任务已取得显著成效，但针对DST的LLM评估研究仍处于探索阶段。本文提出基于GPT-4的二维零样本DST评估方法，将评估划分为准确性和完整性两个维度，并通过设计双重人工推理路径的提示策略进一步提升评估精度。实验表明，该方法相比基线模型具有更优性能，且与传统精确匹配评估结果保持一致性。
