# Learning to Extract Cross-Domain Aspects and Understanding Sentiments Using Large Language Models

原文摘要:
Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ASBA) is a refined approach to sentiment
analysis that aims to extract and classify sentiments based on specific aspects
or features of a product, service, or entity. Unlike traditional sentiment
analysis, which assigns a general sentiment score to entire reviews or texts,
ABSA focuses on breaking down the text into individual components or aspects
(e.g., quality, price, service) and evaluating the sentiment towards each. This
allows for a more granular level of understanding of customer opinions,
enabling businesses to pinpoint specific areas of strength and improvement. The
process involves several key steps, including aspect extraction, sentiment
classification, and aspect-level sentiment aggregation for a review paragraph
or any other form that the users have provided. ABSA has significant
applications in areas such as product reviews, social media monitoring,
customer feedback analysis, and market research. By leveraging techniques from
natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, ABSA facilitates the
extraction of valuable insights, enabling companies to make data-driven
decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and optimize offerings. As ABSA
evolves, it holds the potential to greatly improve personalized customer
experiences by providing a deeper understanding of sentiment across various
product aspects. In this work, we have analyzed the strength of LLMs for a
complete cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis with the aim of defining
the framework for certain products and using it for other similar situations.
We argue that it is possible to that at an effectiveness of 92\% accuracy for
the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis dataset of SemEval-2015 Task 12.

基于方面的情感分析（ASBA）是一种精细化的情感分析方法，其核心在于针对产品、服务或实体的特定属性或特征进行情感提取与分类。与传统情感分析仅对整篇评论或文本赋予整体情感评分不同，ASBA通过将文本分解为独立成分或方面（如质量、价格、服务等），分别评估每个方面的情感倾向。这种方法能更细致地理解客户意见，帮助企业精准识别优势领域和改进方向。该分析流程包含三个关键步骤：方面提取、情感分类，以及对用户提供的评论段落或其他文本形式进行方面级情感聚合。

ASBA在商品评价、社交媒体监测、客户反馈分析和市场研究等领域具有重要应用价值。通过融合自然语言处理（NLP）和机器学习技术，ASBA能有效提取有价值的商业洞察，支持企业做出以数据驱动的决策，从而提升客户满意度并优化产品服务。随着技术发展，ASBA有望通过深度解析产品各维度的情感倾向，显著提升个性化客户体验。

本研究系统评估了大语言模型（LLMs）在跨领域基于方面的情感分析中的性能表现，旨在构建适用于特定产品的分析框架并推广至同类场景。实验结果表明，在SemEval-2015任务12的基于方面情感分析数据集上，该框架可实现92%的准确率。
