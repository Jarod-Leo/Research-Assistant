# GPT4Rec: A Generative Framework for Personalized Recommendation and User Interests Interpretation

原文摘要:
Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the
development of NLP-based recommender systems that have shown superior
performance. However, current models commonly treat items as mere IDs and adopt
discriminative modeling, resulting in limitations of (1) fully leveraging the
content information of items and the language modeling capabilities of NLP
models; (2) interpreting user interests to improve relevance and diversity; and
(3) adapting practical circumstances such as growing item inventories. To
address these limitations, we present GPT4Rec, a novel and flexible generative
framework inspired by search engines. It first generates hypothetical "search
queries" given item titles in a user's history, and then retrieves items for
recommendation by searching these queries. The framework overcomes previous
limitations by learning both user and item embeddings in the language space. To
well-capture user interests with different aspects and granularity for
improving relevance and diversity, we propose a multi-query generation
technique with beam search. The generated queries naturally serve as
interpretable representations of user interests and can be searched to
recommend cold-start items. With GPT-2 language model and BM25 search engine,
our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $75.7\%$ and $22.2\%$ in
Recall@K on two public datasets. Experiments further revealed that multi-query
generation with beam search improves both the diversity of retrieved items and
the coverage of a user's multi-interests. The adaptiveness and interpretability
of generated queries are discussed with qualitative case studies.

自然语言处理（NLP）领域的最新进展催生了基于NLP的推荐系统，其性能表现卓越。然而现有模型通常仅将物品视为标识符并采用判别式建模，导致三大局限：（1）无法充分利用物品内容信息与NLP模型的语言建模能力；（2）难以通过解析用户兴趣提升推荐相关性与多样性；（3）难以适应商品库持续增长等实际场景。为此，我们提出受搜索引擎启发的创新生成框架GPT4Rec：首先根据用户历史行为中的商品标题生成虚拟"搜索查询"，继而通过查询检索实现推荐。该框架通过将用户与物品嵌入语言空间，有效突破了上述局限。为多维度、多粒度捕捉用户兴趣以提升推荐效果，我们结合集束搜索提出多查询生成技术。生成的查询既可直观表征用户兴趣，又能直接用于冷启动物品推荐。采用GPT-2语言模型与BM25搜索引擎的框架在两个公开数据集上，Recall@K指标分别超越现有最优方法75.7%和22.2%。实验进一步表明，基于集束搜索的多查询生成能同时提升推荐多样性与用户多重兴趣的覆盖率。定性案例分析验证了生成查询的自适应能力与可解释性优势。
