# Ophtha-LLaMA2: A Large Language Model for Ophthalmology

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04906v1

原文摘要:
In recent years, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have achieved
tremendous success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Prior
studies have primarily focused on general and generic domains, with relatively
less research on specialized LLMs in the medical field. The specialization and
high accuracy requirements for diagnosis in the medical field, as well as the
challenges in collecting large-scale data, have constrained the application and
development of LLMs in medical scenarios. In the field of ophthalmology,
clinical diagnosis mainly relies on doctors' interpretation of reports and
making diagnostic decisions. In order to take advantage of LLMs to provide
decision support for doctors, we collected three modalities of ophthalmic
report data and fine-tuned the LLaMA2 model, successfully constructing an LLM
termed the "Ophtha-LLaMA2" specifically tailored for ophthalmic disease
diagnosis. Inference test results show that even with a smaller fine-tuning
dataset, Ophtha-LLaMA2 performs significantly better in ophthalmic diagnosis
compared to other LLMs. It demonstrates that the Ophtha-LLaMA2 exhibits
satisfying accuracy and efficiency in ophthalmic disease diagnosis, making it a
valuable tool for ophthalmologists to provide improved diagnostic support for
patients. This research provides a useful reference for the application of LLMs
in the field of ophthalmology, while showcasing the immense potential and
prospects in this domain.

近年来，预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）领域取得了巨大成功。现有研究主要集中于通用领域，针对医学领域专用大模型的研究相对较少。医学领域专业性强、诊断准确性要求高，且大规模数据收集存在困难，这些因素制约了大语言模型在医疗场景中的应用与发展。在眼科领域，临床诊断主要依赖医生解读报告并作出诊断决策。为利用大语言模型为医生提供决策支持，我们收集了三种模态的眼科报告数据并对LLaMA2模型进行微调，成功构建了专用于眼科疾病诊断的大语言模型"Ophtha-LLaMA2"。推理测试结果表明，即使在较小规模的微调数据集下，Ophtha-LLaMA2在眼科诊断方面的表现显著优于其他大语言模型。这表明Ophtha-LLaMA2在眼科疾病诊断中展现出令人满意的准确性和效率，能够成为眼科医生为患者提供更优质诊断支持的有力工具。本研究为大语言模型在眼科领域的应用提供了有益参考，同时展示了该领域的巨大潜力与前景。
