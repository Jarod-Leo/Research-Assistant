原文摘要:
With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), models that
focus on certain domains and languages have been discussed for their necessity.
There is also a growing need for benchmarks to evaluate the performance of
current LLMs in each domain. Therefore, in this study, we constructed a
benchmark comprising multiple tasks specific to the Japanese and financial
domains and performed benchmark measurements on some models. Consequently, we
confirmed that GPT-4 is currently outstanding, and that the constructed
benchmarks function effectively. According to our analysis, our benchmark can
differentiate benchmark scores among models in all performance ranges by
combining tasks with different difficulties.

随着大语言模型（LLM）的快速发展，针对特定领域与语言的模型必要性已成为讨论焦点。当前对各领域LLM性能评估的基准需求也日益增长。为此，本研究构建了一个涵盖日语及金融领域多任务的专用基准测试集，并对部分模型进行了基准测评。结果表明，GPT-4目前表现最为突出，且所构建的基准体系能有效发挥评估功能。通过分析发现，该基准通过整合不同难度任务，可对所有性能区间的模型实现差异化评分。
