原文摘要:
Given that natural language serves as the primary conduit for expressing
thoughts and emotions, text analysis has become a key technique in
psychological research. It enables the extraction of valuable insights from
natural language, facilitating endeavors like personality traits assessment,
mental health monitoring, and sentiment analysis in interpersonal
communications. In text analysis, existing studies often resort to either human
coding, which is time-consuming, using pre-built dictionaries, which often
fails to cover all possible scenarios, or training models from scratch, which
requires large amounts of labeled data. In this tutorial, we introduce the
pretrain-finetune paradigm. The pretrain-finetune paradigm represents a
transformative approach in text analysis and natural language processing. This
paradigm distinguishes itself through the use of large pretrained language
models, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in finetuning tasks, even with
limited training data. This efficiency is especially beneficial for research in
social sciences, where the number of annotated samples is often quite limited.
Our tutorial offers a comprehensive introduction to the pretrain-finetune
paradigm. We first delve into the fundamental concepts of pretraining and
finetuning, followed by practical exercises using real-world applications. We
demonstrate the application of the paradigm across various tasks, including
multi-class classification and regression. Emphasizing its efficacy and
user-friendliness, the tutorial aims to encourage broader adoption of this
paradigm. To this end, we have provided open access to all our code and
datasets. The tutorial is highly beneficial across various psychology
disciplines, providing a comprehensive guide to employing text analysis in
diverse research settings.

鉴于自然语言是表达思想与情感的主要载体，文本分析已成为心理学研究的关键技术。它能从自然语言中提取有价值的洞见，助力人格特质评估、心理健康监测及人际沟通中的情感分析等研究。当前文本分析领域，既有研究多采用耗时的人工编码，或依赖预设词典（往往难以覆盖所有情境），抑或从零训练模型（需大量标注数据）。本教程将介绍"预训练-微调"这一革新范式，该范式通过运用大规模预训练语言模型，在微调任务中展现出卓越效能——即使训练数据有限仍能取得优异表现，这对标注样本通常稀缺的社会科学研究尤为有益。

本教程系统阐释了"预训练-微调"范式的核心要义：首先深入解析预训练与微调的基础概念，继而通过真实应用场景进行实践演练。我们演示了该范式在多分类、回归等多种任务中的具体应用，着重展现其高效性与易用性，以期推动该范式的广泛采用。为此，我们已开源全部代码与数据集。本教程对心理学各分支领域均具重要价值，为不同研究场景下的文本分析应用提供了完整的方法指南。
