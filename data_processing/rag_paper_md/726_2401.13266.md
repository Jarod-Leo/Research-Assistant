原文摘要:
The development of architecture specifications is an initial and fundamental
stage of the integrated circuit (IC) design process. Traditionally,
architecture specifications are crafted by experienced chip architects, a
process that is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. Mistakes in these
specifications may significantly affect subsequent stages of chip design.
Despite the presence of advanced electronic design automation (EDA) tools,
effective solutions to these specification-related challenges remain scarce.
Since writing architecture specifications is naturally a natural language
processing (NLP) task, this paper pioneers the automation of architecture
specification development with the advanced capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Leveraging our definition and dataset, we explore the
application of LLMs in two key aspects of architecture specification
development: (1) Generating architecture specifications, which includes both
writing specifications from scratch and converting RTL code into detailed
specifications. (2) Reviewing existing architecture specifications. We got
promising results indicating that LLMs may revolutionize how these critical
specification documents are developed in IC design nowadays. By reducing the
effort required, LLMs open up new possibilities for efficiency and accuracy in
this crucial aspect of chip design.

架构规范的制定是集成电路(IC)设计流程中最初且至关重要的阶段。传统上，这些规范由经验丰富的芯片架构师手工编写，这一过程不仅耗时耗力，还容易产生疏漏。规范中的错误可能对芯片后续设计阶段造成重大影响。尽管当前电子设计自动化(EDA)工具已十分先进，但针对规范制定环节的有效解决方案仍属稀缺。

鉴于架构规范编写本质上属于自然语言处理(NLP)任务，本文开创性地利用大语言模型(LLM)的先进能力实现架构规范开发的自动化。基于我们定义的框架与数据集，我们探索了LLM在架构规范开发中的两大核心应用：(1)规范生成——包括从零开始撰写规范，以及将RTL代码转化为详细规范文档；(2)现有架构规范的审查验证。实验取得了令人振奋的成果，表明LLM可能彻底改变当前IC设计中关键规范文档的制定方式。通过大幅降低人力需求，LLM为芯片设计这一关键环节的效率与精确性开启了全新可能。
