原文摘要:
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental problem in natural language
processing (NLP). However, the task of extracting longer entity spans (e.g.,
awards) from extended texts (e.g., homepages) is barely explored. Current NER
methods predominantly fall into two categories: span-based methods and
generation-based methods. Span-based methods require the enumeration of all
possible token-pair spans, followed by classification on each span, resulting
in substantial redundant computations and excessive GPU memory usage. In
contrast, generation-based methods involve prompting or fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream NER tasks. However, these methods
struggle with the accurate generation of longer spans and often incur
significant time costs for effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges,
this paper introduces a lightweight span-based NER method called SeNER, which
incorporates a bidirectional arrow attention mechanism coupled with
LogN-Scaling on the [CLS] token to embed long texts effectively, and comprises
a novel bidirectional sliding-window plus-shaped attention (BiSPA) mechanism to
reduce redundant candidate token-pair spans significantly and model
interactions between token-pair spans simultaneously. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art extraction accuracy on
three long NER datasets and is capable of extracting entities from long texts
in a GPU-memory-friendly manner. Code:

命名实体识别（NER）是自然语言处理（NLP）中的基础任务。然而，从长文本（如个人主页）中提取较长实体跨度（如奖项）的研究仍处于探索阶段。现有NER方法主要分为两类：基于跨度的方法和基于生成的方法。基于跨度的方法需枚举所有可能的词对跨度并进行分类，导致大量冗余计算和显存占用；而基于生成的方法通过提示或微调大语言模型（LLMs）适配下游NER任务，但难以准确生成较长跨度且微调时间成本高昂。针对这些问题，本文提出轻量级跨度式NER方法SeNER：通过双向箭头注意力机制结合[CLS]标记的LogN缩放实现长文本嵌入，并设计双向滑动窗口十字形注意力机制（BiSPA）显著减少冗余候选词对跨度，同时建模跨度间交互关系。大量实验表明，该方法在三个长文本NER数据集上达到最优抽取精度，且能以显存高效的方式处理长文本实体抽取。代码地址：https://github.com/THUDM/scholar-profiling/tree/main/sener
