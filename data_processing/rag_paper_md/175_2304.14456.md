# Framing the News:From Human Perception to Large Language Model Inferences

原文摘要:
Identifying the frames of news is important to understand the articles'
vision, intention, message to be conveyed, and which aspects of the news are
emphasized. Framing is a widely studied concept in journalism, and has emerged
as a new topic in computing, with the potential to automate processes and
facilitate the work of journalism professionals. In this paper, we study this
issue with articles related to the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement. First, to
understand the perspectives used to treat this theme, we developed a protocol
for human labeling of frames for 1786 headlines of No-Vax movement articles of
European newspapers from 5 countries. Headlines are key units in the written
press, and worth of analysis as many people only read headlines (or use them to
guide their decision for further reading.) Second, considering advances in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) with large language models, we investigated
two approaches for frame inference of news headlines: first with a GPT-3.5
fine-tuning approach, and second with GPT-3.5 prompt-engineering. Our work
contributes to the study and analysis of the performance that these models have
to facilitate journalistic tasks like classification of frames, while
understanding whether the models are able to replicate human perception in the
identification of these frames.

识别新闻框架对于理解文章的视角、意图、传达的信息以及强调的新闻面向至关重要。框架分析作为新闻学领域广泛研究的概念，现已成为计算科学的新兴课题，其自动化潜力有望革新新闻从业者的工作流程。本文以欧洲五国反疫苗运动相关报道为研究对象展开探讨：首先，为厘清该主题的报道视角，我们开发了人工标注协议，对1786篇欧洲报纸反疫苗运动文章标题进行框架标注（标题作为纸媒核心单元具有独立分析价值，因多数读者仅浏览标题或据此决定深度阅读）。其次，基于自然语言处理（NLP）大语言模型的技术进展，我们探究了两种新闻标题框架推断方法：一是GPT-3.5微调方法，二是GPT-3.5提示工程。本研究通过评估模型在框架分类等新闻任务中的表现，深入考察了模型能否复现人类在框架识别中的认知逻辑，为智能化新闻分析提供了实践参考。
