# Evaluating Large Language Models for Radiology Natural Language Processing

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13693v1

原文摘要:
The rise of large language models (LLMs) has marked a pivotal shift in the
field of natural language processing (NLP). LLMs have revolutionized a
multitude of domains, and they have made a significant impact in the medical
field. Large language models are now more abundant than ever, and many of these
models exhibit bilingual capabilities, proficient in both English and Chinese.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these models remains to be conducted.
This lack of assessment is especially apparent within the context of radiology
NLP. This study seeks to bridge this gap by critically evaluating thirty two
LLMs in interpreting radiology reports, a crucial component of radiology NLP.
Specifically, the ability to derive impressions from radiologic findings is
assessed. The outcomes of this evaluation provide key insights into the
performance, strengths, and weaknesses of these LLMs, informing their practical
applications within the medical domain.

大型语言模型（LLMs）的崛起标志着自然语言处理（NLP）领域的重大变革。这些模型已彻底改变多个领域，并在医学界产生了深远影响。当前大型语言模型数量空前增长，其中许多具备中英双语能力。然而，对这些模型的系统性评估仍属空白，这一缺失在放射学NLP领域尤为明显。本研究通过评估32个LLMs在解读放射学报告（放射学NLP的核心任务）中的表现来填补这一空白，重点测试模型从影像学表现推导诊断印象的能力。评估结果揭示了各模型的性能表现、优势与局限，为医学领域的实际应用提供了关键参考依据。
