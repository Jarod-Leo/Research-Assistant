原文摘要:
Since their inception, embeddings have become a primary ingredient in many
flavours of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks supplanting earlier types
of representation. Even though multilingual embeddings have been used for the
increasing number of multilingual tasks, due to the scarcity of parallel
training data, low-resource languages such as Sinhala, tend to focus more on
monolingual embeddings. Then when it comes to the aforementioned multi-lingual
tasks, it is challenging to utilize these monolingual embeddings given that
even if the embedding spaces have a similar geometric arrangement due to an
identical training process, the embeddings of the languages considered are not
aligned. This is solved by the embedding alignment task. Even in this,
high-resource language pairs are in the limelight while low-resource languages
such as Sinhala which is in dire need of help seem to have fallen by the
wayside. In this paper, we try to align Sinhala and English word embedding
spaces based on available alignment techniques and introduce a benchmark for
Sinhala language embedding alignment. In addition to that, to facilitate the
supervised alignment, as an intermediate task, we also introduce
Sinhala-English alignment datasets. These datasets serve as our anchor datasets
for supervised word embedding alignment. Even though we do not obtain results
comparable to the high-resource languages such as French, German, or Chinese,
we believe our work lays the groundwork for more specialized alignment between
English and Sinhala embeddings.

自诞生以来，词嵌入技术已取代早期表征方式，成为各类自然语言处理任务的核心要素。尽管多语言嵌入在日益增多的跨语言任务中得到应用，但由于平行训练数据的匮乏，僧伽罗语等低资源语言仍主要聚焦于单语词嵌入研究。当涉及前述多语言任务时，这些未经对齐的单语嵌入面临应用挑战——即便采用相同训练流程使嵌入空间具有相似几何结构，不同语言的嵌入向量仍缺乏对应关系。这一难题催生了嵌入对齐任务的研究。然而现有研究多集中于高资源语言对，亟需技术支持的僧伽罗语等低资源语言却鲜有关注。本文基于现有对齐技术尝试构建僧伽罗语-英语词嵌入空间映射，并首次建立僧伽罗语词嵌入对齐评估基准。为支撑监督式对齐研究，我们作为中间任务同步发布了僧伽罗语-英语对齐数据集，这些数据集将作为监督式词嵌入对齐的锚定数据。虽然当前成果在准确率上尚未达到法语、德语或汉语等高资源语言的水平，但我们相信这项工作为英语-僧伽罗语词嵌入的专项对齐研究奠定了重要基础。
