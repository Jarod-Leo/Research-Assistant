原文摘要:
In recent times, Transformer-based language models are making quite an impact
in the field of natural language processing. As relevant parallels can be drawn
between biological sequences and natural languages, the models used in NLP can
be easily extended and adapted for various applications in bioinformatics. In
this regard, this paper introduces the major developments of Transformer-based
models in the recent past in the context of nucleotide sequences. We have
reviewed and analysed a large number of application-based papers on this
subject, giving evidence of the main characterizing features and to different
approaches that may be adopted to customize such powerful computational
machines. We have also provided a structured description of the functioning of
Transformers, that may enable even first time users to grab the essence of such
complex architectures. We believe this review will help the scientific
community in understanding the various applications of Transformer-based
language models to nucleotide sequences. This work will motivate the readers to
build on these methodologies to tackle also various other problems in the field
of bioinformatics.
