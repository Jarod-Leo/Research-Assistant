# Fairness Definitions in Language Models Explained

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18454v1

原文摘要:
Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these advancements,
LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes
such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications.
Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the
proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on
which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts (\textit{e.g.,}
medium-sized LMs versus large-sized LMs) and the complexity of understanding
the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede
further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that
clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we
begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a
comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the
introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their
foundational principles and operational distinctions. We further illustrate
each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications
and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open
questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field. The
implementation and additional resources are publicly available at

语言模型（Language Models, LMs）在各类自然语言处理（NLP）任务中展现出卓越性能。然而，尽管技术进步显著，这些模型仍可能继承并放大与性别、种族等敏感属性相关的社会偏见，从而限制其在实际场景中的应用。为此，针对语言模型的公平性问题已展开广泛研究，并提出了多种公平性概念。但由于缺乏对特定情境（如中型LMs与大型LMs）下适用何种公平定义的明确共识，加之理解不同定义间差异的复杂性，当前研究易陷入困惑并阻碍进展。

本文提出一项系统性综述，旨在厘清适用于语言模型的公平性定义。具体而言，我们首先简要介绍语言模型及其公平性问题，随后全面梳理最新研究进展，提出基于理论基础与操作差异的新型分类体系，对现有公平性概念进行系统归类。通过实验演示，我们进一步阐释各定义的实际应用效果与影响。最后，探讨当前研究挑战与开放性问题，以推动创新思路与领域发展。相关实现代码及资源已公开于https://github.com/LavinWong/Fairness-in-Large-Language-Models/tree/main/definitions。
