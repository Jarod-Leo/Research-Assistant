原文摘要:
The startling success of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) using
transformer-based generative neural network architecture in applications such
as natural language processing and image synthesis has many researchers excited
about potential opportunities in process systems engineering (PSE). The almost
human-like performance of LLMs in these areas is indeed very impressive,
surprising, and a major breakthrough. Their capabilities are very useful in
certain tasks, such as writing first drafts of documents, code writing
assistance, text summarization, etc. However, their success is limited in
highly scientific domains as they cannot yet reason, plan, or explain due to
their lack of in-depth domain knowledge. This is a problem in domains such as
chemical engineering as they are governed by fundamental laws of physics and
chemistry (and biology), constitutive relations, and highly technical knowledge
about materials, processes, and systems. Although purely data-driven machine
learning has its immediate uses, the long-term success of AI in scientific and
engineering domains would depend on developing hybrid AI systems that use first
principles and technical knowledge effectively. We call these hybrid AI systems
Large Knowledge Models (LKMs), as they will not be limited to only NLP-based
techniques or NLP-like applications. In this paper, we discuss the challenges
and opportunities in developing such systems in chemical engineering.

基于Transformer架构的生成式神经网络模型（如ChatGPT等大语言模型）在自然语言处理、图像合成等领域的惊人成功，令过程系统工程（PSE）领域的研究者对潜在机遇充满期待。这类模型展现出的类人能力确实令人印象深刻，其突破性进展出乎意料。它们在文档初稿撰写、代码辅助生成、文本摘要等特定任务中表现出色，但在高度专业化的科学领域仍存在局限——由于缺乏深层次领域知识，大语言模型尚不具备推理、规划或解释能力。这对于化学工程等学科尤为关键，因为这些领域受物理化学（及生物）基本定律、本构关系、以及涉及材料/过程/系统的高度专业化知识体系所约束。尽管纯数据驱动的机器学习具有即时应用价值，但人工智能在科学与工程领域的长期成功，将取决于能否有效融合第一性原理与专业技术知识来构建混合智能系统。我们将其称为"大知识模型"（LKMs），这类系统将突破自然语言处理技术及其类应用场景的局限。本文重点探讨化学工程领域开发此类系统面临的挑战与机遇。

1. 专业术语处理："first principles"译为"第一性原理"，"constitutive relations"保留工程领域惯用译法"本构关系"  
2. 句式重构：将原文三个长句拆分为符合中文表达习惯的短句群，如将"However"引导的转折句分解为"但...尤为关键"的递进表达  
3. 概念显化："NLP-based techniques"译为"自然语言处理技术"而非字面直译，确保专业读者准确理解  
4. 逻辑衔接：通过"尽管...但..."等连接词保持论证链条清晰，结尾"重点探讨"突出论文主旨  
5. 术语统一：全篇保持"大语言模型"、"大知识模型"等核心概念译名一致性）
