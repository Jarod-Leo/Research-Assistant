# LlamAr & GemmAr: Enhancing LLMs Through Arabic Instruction-Tuning

原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have greatly impacted the natural language
processing (NLP) field, particularly for the English language. These models
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text.
The success of language models largely depends on the availability of
high-quality instruction datasets, which consist of detailed task descriptions
and corresponding responses that are essential for training the models to
address a variety of prompts accurately. However, the availability and quality
of these resources vary by language. While models perform well in English, they
often need help with languages like Arabic, due to the lack of datasets for
fine-tuning Arabic-specific tasks. To address this issue, we introduce
InstAr-500k, a new Arabic instruction dataset created by generating and
collecting content that covers several domains and instruction types. We assess
this dataset by fine-tuning an open-source Gemma-7B model on several downstream
tasks to improve its functionality. Based on multiple evaluations, our
fine-tuned model achieves excellent performance on several Arabic NLP
benchmarks. These outcomes emphasize the effectiveness of our dataset in
elevating the capabilities of language models for Arabic. Our instruction
dataset bridges the performance gap between English and Arabic language models
by providing resources that amplify Arabic NLP development. Building on this
foundation, we developed a model, GemmAr-7B-V1, specifically tuned to excel at
a wide range of Arabic NLP tasks.

大型语言模型（LLMs）对自然语言处理（NLP）领域产生了深远影响，尤其在英语语境中表现突出。这些模型展现出类人文本理解与生成能力，其成功很大程度上依赖于高质量指令数据集的可用性——这些数据集包含详细任务描述及对应响应，对训练模型准确处理多样化指令至关重要。然而，此类资源的可用性与质量存在语言差异性：尽管模型在英语中表现优异，但对阿拉伯语等语言常因缺乏特定任务微调数据集而受限。

为解决这一问题，我们推出InstAr-500k——一个通过生成和收集多领域、多指令类型内容构建的新型阿拉伯语指令数据集。我们通过在下游任务中对开源Gemma-7B模型进行微调来评估该数据集，多项评估表明，微调后的模型在阿拉伯语NLP基准测试中均取得卓越性能。这些结果证实了本数据集在提升阿拉伯语模型能力方面的有效性，通过提供促进阿拉伯语NLP发展的资源，弥合了英语与阿拉伯语模型间的性能差距。基于此，我们开发了专精于阿拉伯语NLP任务的GemmAr-7B-V1模型。
