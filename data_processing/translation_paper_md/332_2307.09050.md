原文摘要:
Transformer-based models have gained popularity in the field of natural
language processing (NLP) and are extensively utilized in computer vision tasks
and multi-modal models such as GPT4. This paper presents a novel method to
enhance the explainability of Transformer-based image classification models.
Our method aims to improve trust in classification results and empower users to
gain a deeper understanding of the model for downstream tasks by providing
visualizations of class-specific maps. We introduce two modules: the
``Relationship Weighted Out" and the ``Cut" modules. The ``Relationship
Weighted Out" module focuses on extracting class-specific information from
intermediate layers, enabling us to highlight relevant features. Additionally,
the ``Cut" module performs fine-grained feature decomposition, taking into
account factors such as position, texture, and color. By integrating these
modules, we generate dense class-specific visual explainability maps. We
validate our method with extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on
the ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, we conduct a large number of experiments on
the LRN dataset, specifically designed for automatic driving danger alerts, to
evaluate the explainability of our method in complex backgrounds. The results
demonstrate a significant improvement over previous methods. Moreover, we
conduct ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of each module.
Through these experiments, we are able to confirm the respective contributions
of each module, thus solidifying the overall effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

基于Transformer的模型在自然语言处理（NLP）领域广受欢迎，并已广泛应用于计算机视觉任务及GPT4等多模态模型。本文提出一种创新方法，旨在增强基于Transformer的图像分类模型的可解释性。该方法通过提供类别专属特征可视化图谱，既提升了分类结果的可信度，又能帮助用户深入理解模型特性以支持下游任务。我们设计了两大核心模块："关系权重输出"模块专注于从中间层提取类别专属信息以突出相关特征；"特征切割"模块则通过位置、纹理、色彩等多维度要素实现细粒度特征解构。通过模块协同，系统可生成高密度的类别专属可视化解释图谱。我们在ImageNet数据集上进行了系统的定性与定量实验验证，并针对自动驾驶危险预警专门设计的LRN数据集开展大规模测试，以评估方法在复杂背景下的解释能力。实验结果表明，本方法较现有技术实现显著提升。此外，消融实验证实了各模块的有效性，通过量化分析明确了各模块的具体贡献，从而全面验证了本方法的整体效能。
