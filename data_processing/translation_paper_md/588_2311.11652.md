# Web News Timeline Generation with Extended Task Prompting

原文摘要:
The creation of news timeline is essential for a comprehensive and contextual
understanding of events as they unfold over time. This approach aids in
discerning patterns and trends that might be obscured when news is viewed in
isolation. By organizing news in a chronological sequence, it becomes easier to
track the development of stories, understand the interrelation of events, and
grasp the broader implications of news items. This is particularly helpful in
sectors like finance and insurance, where timely understanding of the event
development-ranging from extreme weather to political upheavals and health
crises-is indispensable for effective risk management. While traditional
natural language processing (NLP) techniques have had some success, they often
fail to capture the news with nuanced relevance that are readily apparent to
domain experts, hindering broader industry integration. The advance of Large
Language Models (LLMs) offers a renewed opportunity to tackle this challenge.
However, direct prompting LLMs for this task is often ineffective. Our study
investigates the application of an extended task prompting technique to assess
past news relevance. We demonstrate that enhancing conventional prompts with
additional tasks boosts their effectiveness on various news dataset, rendering
news timeline generation practical for professional use. This work has been
deployed as a publicly accessible browser extension which is adopted within our

新闻时间线的构建对于全面、情境化地理解事件随时间发展的过程至关重要。该方法有助于识别在孤立阅读新闻时可能被掩盖的模式与趋势。通过按时间顺序组织新闻，人们能更轻松地追踪事件发展脉络、理解事件间的关联性，并把握新闻事件的深层影响。这在金融与保险等领域尤为实用——无论是极端天气、政治动荡还是健康危机，及时掌握事件动态对有效风险管理不可或缺。

尽管传统自然语言处理（NLP）技术已取得部分成果，但其往往难以捕捉领域专家可直观感知的细微关联，阻碍了在行业中的广泛应用。大型语言模型（LLM）的发展为解决这一难题提供了新机遇，但直接使用基础提示（prompting）方法效果有限。本研究探索了一种扩展任务提示技术，用于评估历史新闻的相关性。实验证明，通过附加任务增强传统提示模板，可显著提升模型在多种新闻数据集上的表现，使新闻时间线生成具备实际应用价值。
