原文摘要:
Text simplification is one of the domains in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) that offers an opportunity to understand the text in a simplified manner
for exploration. However, it is always hard to understand and retrieve
knowledge from unstructured text, which is usually in the form of compound and
complex sentences. There are state-of-the-art neural network-based methods to
simplify the sentences for improved readability while replacing words with
plain English substitutes and summarising the sentences and paragraphs. In the
Knowledge Graph (KG) creation process from unstructured text, summarising long
sentences and substituting words is undesirable since this may lead to
information loss. However, KG creation from text requires the extraction of all
possible facts (triples) with the same mentions as in the text. In this work,
we propose a controlled simplification based on the factual information in a
sentence, i.e., triple. We present a classical syntactic dependency-based
approach to split and rephrase a compound and complex sentence into a set of
simplified sentences. This simplification process will retain the original
wording with a simple structure of possible domain facts in each sentence,
i.e., triples. The paper also introduces an algorithm to identify and measure a
sentence's syntactic complexity (SC), followed by reduction through a
controlled syntactic simplification process. Last, an experiment for a dataset
re-annotation is also conducted through GPT3; we aim to publish this refined
corpus as a resource. This work is accepted and presented in International
workshop on Learning with Knowledge Graphs (IWLKG) at WSDM-2023 Conference. The
code and data is available at www.github.com/sallmanm/SynSim.

文本简化是自然语言处理（NLP）领域中的一个研究方向，旨在通过简化文本促进内容理解与探索。然而，从非结构化文本（通常以复合句和复杂句形式存在）中准确理解并提取知识始终具有挑战性。当前最先进的神经网络方法通过替换通俗词汇及压缩句子段落来提升文本可读性，但在从非结构化文本构建知识图谱（KG）的过程中，过度压缩长句或替换词汇可能导致信息丢失。知识图谱构建要求完整保留原文表述的所有可能事实（三元组）。本研究提出一种基于句子事实信息（即三元组）的受控简化方法，采用经典句法依存分析技术将复合复杂句拆解并重述为多个简化句。该简化过程通过保持原始措辞与简单句式结构，确保每个句子中潜在的领域事实（三元组）完整性。本文还提出一种算法用于量化句子的句法复杂度（SC），并通过受控句法简化流程实现复杂度降低。最后，我们利用GPT-3进行了数据集重标注实验，计划将优化后的语料作为资源公开发布。本研究成果已被WSDM-2023会议"知识图谱学习国际研讨会（IWLKG）"收录，相关代码与数据详见www.github.com/sallmanm/SynSim。
