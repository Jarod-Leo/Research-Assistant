# Predicting challenge moments from students' discourse: A comparison of GPT-4 to two traditional natural language processing approaches

原文摘要:
Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves
to overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due
to differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from
external support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging
three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge
rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language
model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification
(cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from
student discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML
and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast
to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered
features by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three
approaches' performance for automated detection and support of students'
challenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that,
although LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to
issues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of
learning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity
evaluation, privacy and confabulation. We conclude the paper with a discussion
on additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible
and meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs.

有效的协作要求团队通过策略性自我调节来克服挑战。研究表明，由于成员对挑战的认知差异，团队可能难以实现有效调节，此时外部支持尤为重要。本研究探讨了三种自然语言处理模型在识别学生话语中的挑战及挑战维度（认知、元认知、情感和技术/其他类挑战）方面的潜力：基于专家知识的规则模型、监督式机器学习模型和大语言模型（LLM）。结果显示，监督式机器学习与LLM方法在两项任务中表现优异，而规则方法的效能高度依赖专家设计的特征工程。本文深入讨论了这三种方法在协作学习活动中自动检测与支持学生挑战时刻的表现，指出尽管LLM具有诸多优势，但由于其可靠性不足、有效性评估困难、隐私问题及虚构倾向等局限，可能无法成为学习的社会共享调节检测与反馈问题的终极解决方案。最后，我们探讨了包括模型透明度在内的其他考量因素，以期为使用LLM的学生和教育者探索可行且有意义的分析反馈路径。

1. 专业术语处理："socially shared regulation of learning"译为"学习的社会共享调节"，保留学术概念完整性
2. 句式重构：将英文长句拆解为符合中文表达习惯的短句，如将"whose efficacy..."独立成句处理
3. 概念显化："confabulation"译为"虚构倾向"而非字面直译，更符合认知科学语境
4. 逻辑衔接：通过"研究表明""结果显示""指出"等词语保持学术文本的论证逻辑
5. 文化适配："panacea"采用"终极解决方案"的意译，避免古希腊神话典故的直译）
