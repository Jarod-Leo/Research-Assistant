原文摘要:
In the upcoming 6G era, vehicular networks are shifting from simple
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to the more complex
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity. At the forefront of this shift is the
incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into vehicles. Known for their
sophisticated natural language processing abilities, LLMs change how users
interact with their vehicles. This integration facilitates voice-driven
commands and interactions, departing from the conventional manual control
systems. However, integrating LLMs into vehicular systems presents notable
challenges. The substantial computational demands and energy requirements of
LLMs pose significant challenges, especially in the constrained environment of
a vehicle. Additionally, the time-sensitive nature of tasks in vehicular
networks adds another layer of complexity. In this paper, we consider an edge
computing system where vehicles process the initial layers of LLM computations
locally, and offload the remaining LLM computation tasks to the Roadside Units
(RSUs), envisioning a vehicular ecosystem where LLM computations seamlessly
interact with the ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth capabilities of 6G
networks. To balance the trade-off between completion time and energy
consumption, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize
the total cost of the vehicles and RSUs. The problem is then decomposed into
two sub-problems, which are solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP)
method and fractional programming technique. The simulation results clearly
indicate that the algorithm we have proposed is highly effective in reducing
both the completion time and energy consumption of the system.

在即将到来的6G时代，车载网络正从简单的车对车（V2V）通信向更复杂的车联万物（V2X）模式转型。这一变革的核心在于将大语言模型（LLMs）集成到车辆系统中。凭借其卓越的自然语言处理能力，LLMs彻底改变了用户与车辆的交互方式，推动传统手动控制系统向语音驱动交互转型。然而，LLMs在车载系统的部署面临显著挑战：其庞大的计算需求和能耗压力与车辆有限的计算资源形成矛盾，而车联网任务的时效敏感性进一步增加了复杂性。本文提出一种边缘计算架构，车辆本地处理LLMs的浅层计算，其余任务卸载至路侧单元（RSUs），构建LLM计算与6G超低时延、高带宽特性深度融合的车载生态系统。为权衡任务完成时间与能耗，我们建立多目标优化问题以最小化车辆与RSUs的总成本，并通过序列二次规划（SQP）和分式规划技术分解求解两个子问题。仿真结果表明，所提算法能显著降低系统时延与能耗。
