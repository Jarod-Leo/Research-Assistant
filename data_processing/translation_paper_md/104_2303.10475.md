# Is Prompt All You Need? No. A Comprehensive and Broader View of Instruction Learning

原文摘要:
Task semantics can be expressed by a set of input-output examples or a piece
of textual instruction. Conventional machine learning approaches for natural
language processing (NLP) mainly rely on the availability of large-scale sets
of task-specific examples. Two issues arise: first, collecting task-specific
labeled examples does not apply to scenarios where tasks may be too complicated
or costly to annotate, or the system is required to handle a new task
immediately; second, this is not user-friendly since end-users are probably
more willing to provide task description rather than a set of examples before
using the system. Therefore, the community is paying increasing interest in a
new supervision-seeking paradigm for NLP: learning to follow task instructions,
i.e., instruction following. Despite its impressive progress, there are some
common issues that the community struggles with. This survey paper tries to
summarize and provide insights to the current research on instruction
following, particularly, by answering the following questions: (i) What is task
instruction, and what instruction types exist? (ii) How to model instructions?
(iii) What are popular instruction following datasets and evaluation metrics?
(iv) What factors influence and explain the instructions' performance? (v) What
challenges remain in instruction following? To our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive survey about instruction following.

任务语义可以通过一组输入-输出示例或一段文本指令来表达。传统的自然语言处理（NLP）机器学习方法主要依赖于大规模任务特定示例的可用性。这引发了两个问题：首先，收集任务特定的标注示例并不适用于任务过于复杂或标注成本过高的情况，也不适用于系统需要立即处理新任务的场景；其次，这种方式对用户不够友好，因为终端用户在使用系统前可能更倾向于提供任务描述而非一组示例。因此，学术界对NLP领域一种新的监督范式日益关注：学习遵循任务指令，即指令跟随。尽管该领域取得了显著进展，但仍存在一些普遍困扰研究者的问题。本综述论文试图通过回答以下问题，对当前指令跟随研究进行总结并提供见解：（i）什么是任务指令？存在哪些指令类型？（ii）如何对指令建模？（iii）有哪些主流的指令跟随数据集和评估指标？（iv）哪些因素影响并解释指令的性能表现？（v）指令跟随领域仍面临哪些挑战？据我们所知，这是首篇关于指令跟随的全面综述。
