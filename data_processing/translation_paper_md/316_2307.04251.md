# ChatGPT in the Age of Generative AI and Large Language Models: A Concise Survey

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04251v1

原文摘要:
ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) created by OpenAI that has been
carefully trained on a large amount of data. It has revolutionized the field of
natural language processing (NLP) and has pushed the boundaries of LLM
capabilities. ChatGPT has played a pivotal role in enabling widespread public
interaction with generative artificial intelligence (GAI) on a large scale. It
has also sparked research interest in developing similar technologies and
investigating their applications and implications. In this paper, our primary
goal is to provide a concise survey on the current lines of research on ChatGPT
and its evolution. We considered both the glass box and black box views of
ChatGPT, encompassing the components and foundational elements of the
technology, as well as its applications, impacts, and implications. The glass
box approach focuses on understanding the inner workings of the technology, and
the black box approach embraces it as a complex system, and thus examines its
inputs, outputs, and effects. This paves the way for a comprehensive
exploration of the technology and provides a road map for further research and
experimentation. We also lay out essential foundational literature on LLMs and
GAI in general and their connection with ChatGPT. This overview sheds light on
existing and missing research lines in the emerging field of LLMs, benefiting
both public users and developers. Furthermore, the paper delves into the broad
spectrum of applications and significant concerns in fields such as education,
research, healthcare, finance, etc.

ChatGPT是由OpenAI开发的大型语言模型（LLM），基于海量数据经过精细训练而成。该模型不仅革新了自然语言处理（NLP）领域，更突破了大型语言模型的能力边界。作为推动生成式人工智能（GAI）大规模公众交互的关键推手，ChatGPT同时激发了学界对同类技术研发及其应用影响的探索热情。本文旨在系统梳理ChatGPT的研究进展与技术演进脉络，通过"透明盒"与"黑盒"双重视角展开分析：前者聚焦技术内部架构与基础组件，后者则将其视为复杂系统，考察其输入输出及衍生影响。这种研究框架既为全面技术探索铺平道路，也为后续研究实验提供路线图。我们系统整合了LLM与GAI领域的基础文献，阐明其与ChatGPT的关联，从而揭示这一新兴领域现有研究脉络与空白地带，为公众用户和开发者提供参考。此外，本文深入探讨了该模型在教育、科研、医疗、金融等领域的广泛应用场景及引发的重大关切。

1. 专业术语准确统一（如LLM/GAI等保持英文缩写）  
2. 长句拆分符合中文表达习惯（如将复合从句转化为分号短句）  
3. 被动语态主动化处理（如"has been carefully trained"译为"经过精细训练"）  
4. 学术用语规范化（"glass box/black box"采用引号标注的"透明盒/黑盒"译法）  
5. 逻辑连接词显性化（添加"前者/后者"等衔接词增强可读性））
