原文摘要:
With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems
(RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing
personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender
systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side
information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in
understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information,
inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning
on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their
remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding
and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning
capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power
of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this
research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a
systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems,
to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding.
Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered
recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning,
and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to
harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations
of users and items. Then, we review recent techniques of LLMs for enhancing
recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and
prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss future directions in this
emerging field.

随着电子商务和网络应用的蓬勃发展，推荐系统（RecSys）已成为日常生活中不可或缺的组成部分，通过提供符合用户偏好的个性化建议来优化用户体验。尽管深度神经网络（DNNs）在建模用户-物品交互和整合文本辅助信息方面显著推动了推荐系统的发展，但基于DNN的方法仍存在诸多局限，例如难以精准理解用户兴趣、有效捕捉文本辅助信息、无法适应多样化推荐场景以及对预测结果进行合理解释等。与此同时，以ChatGPT和GPT4为代表的大语言模型（LLMs）凭借其在语言理解与生成方面的卓越能力，以及惊人的泛化与推理性能，正在彻底革新自然语言处理（NLP）和人工智能（AI）领域。这一突破性进展促使学界开始探索如何利用LLMs来增强推荐系统。鉴于该研究方向在推荐系统领域的快速发展，亟需一份系统性综述来梳理现有基于LLMs的推荐系统，为相关领域研究者提供深入洞察。为此，本文从预训练、微调和提示学习三大技术路径出发，对LLM赋能的推荐系统进行了全面回顾。具体而言，我们首先阐释了利用LLMs（作为特征编码器）学习用户与物品表征的代表性方法；继而从预训练、微调和提示学习三大范式系统梳理了当前LLMs增强推荐系统的最新研究进展；最后对这一新兴领域的未来发展方向进行了多维度的前瞻性讨论。
