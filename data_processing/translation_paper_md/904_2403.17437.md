原文摘要:
Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, an increasing number of ChatGPT-related
projects are being published on GitHub, sparking widespread discussions.
However, GitHub does not provide a detailed classification of these projects to
help users effectively explore interested projects. Additionally, the issues
raised by users for these projects cover various aspects, e.g., installation,
usage, and updates. It would be valuable to help developers prioritize more
urgent issues and improve development efficiency. We retrieved 71,244 projects
from GitHub using the keyword `ChatGPT' and selected the top 200 representative
projects with the highest numbers of stars as our dataset. By analyzing the
project descriptions, we identified three primary categories of ChatGPT-related
projects, namely ChatGPT Implementation & Training, ChatGPT Application,
ChatGPT Improvement & Extension. Next, we applied a topic modeling technique to
23,609 issues of those projects and identified ten issue topics, e.g., model
reply and interaction interface. We further analyzed the popularity,
difficulty, and evolution of each issue topic within the three project
categories. Our main findings are: 1) The increase in the number of projects
within the three categories is closely related to the development of ChatGPT;
and 2) There are significant differences in the popularity, difficulty, and
evolutionary trends of the issue topics across the three project categories.
Based on these findings, we finally provided implications for project
developers and platform managers on how to better develop and manage
ChatGPT-related projects.

自2022年ChatGPT发布以来，GitHub上涌现出越来越多与之相关的项目，引发广泛讨论。然而GitHub平台并未对这些项目进行细粒度分类以帮助用户有效探索感兴趣的项目。同时用户为这些项目提交的议题（issue）涉及安装、使用、更新等多个维度，若能帮助开发者识别需优先处理的紧急议题，将有效提升开发效率。我们通过关键词`ChatGPT`从GitHub检索到71,244个项目，并筛选出星标数最高的200个代表性项目作为数据集。通过分析项目描述，识别出ChatGPT相关项目的三大主要类别：ChatGPT实现与训练、ChatGPT应用、ChatGPT改进与扩展。继而采用主题建模技术对23,609条项目议题进行分析，提炼出模型回复、交互界面等十大议题主题，并进一步分析三类项目中各议题主题的热度、解决难度及演化规律。主要发现包括：1）三类项目数量的增长与ChatGPT的发展进程密切相关；2）不同项目类别中议题主题的热度、难度及演化趋势存在显著差异。基于这些发现，我们最终为项目开发者和平台管理者如何更好地开发和管理ChatGPT相关项目提出了建议。
