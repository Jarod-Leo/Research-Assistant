原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to a wide range of
tools, tasks, and problem-solving processes, especially in software
development. Originally designed for natural language processing tasks such as
text generation, LLMs are increasingly being used to assist both professionals
and students in writing code. This growing reliance on LLM-based tools is
reshaping programming workflows and task execution. In this study, we explore
the impact of these technologies on blind and low-vision (BLV) developers. Our
review of existing literature indicates that while LLMs help mitigate some of
the challenges faced by BLV programmers, they also introduce new forms of
inaccessibility. We conducted an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered
integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance across
a comprehensive set of programming tasks. Our findings highlight several
unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and notable
limitations in interaction support for specific tasks. Through observing BLV
developers as they engaged in coding activities, we uncovered key interaction
barriers that go beyond model accuracy or code generation quality. This paper
outlines the challenges and corresponding opportunities for improving
accessibility in the context of generative AI-assisted programming. Addressing
these issues can meaningfully enhance the programming experience for BLV
developers. As the generative AI revolution continues to unfold, it must also
address the unique burdens faced by this community.

大型语言模型（LLMs）正迅速成为各类工具、任务和问题解决流程中不可或缺的组成部分，尤其在软件开发领域尤为显著。这类最初为文本生成等自然语言处理任务设计的模型，正日益被用于协助专业人士和学生编写代码。基于LLM的工具日益普及，正在重塑编程工作流和任务执行方式。本研究探讨了这些技术对盲人及低视力（BLV）开发者的影响。通过对现有文献的梳理，我们发现LLMs虽然能缓解BLV程序员面临的某些挑战，但同时也带来了新型的无障碍障碍。我们评估了五款主流LLM驱动的集成开发环境（IDE），对其在综合编程任务中的表现进行了系统测评。研究结果揭示了若干未获支持的场景、模型输出错误案例，以及在特定任务交互支持方面的显著局限。通过观察BLV开发者进行编码活动的过程，我们发现了超越模型准确性或代码生成质量的关键交互障碍。本文阐述了生成式AI辅助编程背景下存在的无障碍挑战及相应改进机遇。解决这些问题将切实提升BLV开发者的编程体验。随着生成式AI革命的持续推进，必须重视并解决这一群体面临的独特困境。
