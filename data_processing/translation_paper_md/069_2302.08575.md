原文摘要:
This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the
art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for
readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over
the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training
models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text
documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information.
Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with
superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed
by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be
applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from
image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a
blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been
called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction to basic NLP models the
main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer
are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive
embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed,
such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input
texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models
for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering,
translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text,
etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models
are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition,
links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter
summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential
developments of AI.

这本开放获取的书籍全面综述了基础模型的研究与应用现状，适合具备自然语言处理（NLP）基础知识的读者阅读。近年来，一种革命性的新型范式被开发用于训练NLP模型。这些模型首先在大量文本语料库上进行预训练，以获取通用句法知识和语义信息；随后通过微调适应特定任务，往往能以超乎人类的准确度解决问题。当模型规模足够大时，仅需通过提示指令即可解决新任务而无需微调。此外，这类模型可广泛应用于图像视频处理、机器人控制学习等跨媒体问题领域。由于为人工智能多任务处理提供了通用解决方案，它们被称为"基础模型"。本书在简要介绍NLP基础模型后，重点阐述了BERT、GPT和序列到序列Transformer等主流预训练语言模型，以及自注意力机制与上下文敏感嵌入等核心概念。随后探讨了改进模型的多种路径，包括扩展预训练标准、增加输入文本长度、融入外部知识等。书中系统梳理了约二十个应用领域（如问答系统、机器翻译、故事生成、对话系统、文生图等）的最佳实践模型，针对每个领域详细分析现有模型的优势局限，并展望未来发展方向。全书还提供了可公开获取的程序代码资源链接。末章总结了人工智能带来的经济机遇、风险防控措施及潜在发展趋势。
