# Tele-LLMs: A Series of Specialized Large Language Models for Telecommunications

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05314v1

原文摘要:
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted
various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and
finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs
in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models
that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results
in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific
technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This
paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a
comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant
sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to
the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective
training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging
from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications
aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how
models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of
their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and
open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to
8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations
demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on
Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their
previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting
phenomenon.

大型语言模型（LLMs）的兴起已深刻影响着从自然语言处理到医疗、金融等多个领域。然而尽管其应用迅速扩展，LLMs在电信领域的应用仍显不足，主要依赖缺乏领域专业性的通用模型。这种专业性的缺失导致模型表现欠佳，尤其在处理电信领域特有的技术术语及相关数学表达时更为明显。

本文通过构建并开源Tele-Data（从相关资源整理的电信领域综合数据集）和Tele-Eval（针对该领域定制的大规模问答数据集）来填补这一空白。通过大量实验，我们探索了将LLMs适配电信领域的最有效训练技术：从研究电信各细分领域的专业知识划分，到应用参数高效微调方法。同时我们分析了不同规模模型在领域适配中的表现差异，并研究了其训练数据对适配过程的影响。

基于这些发现，我们开发并开源了Tele-LLMs系列模型（参数规模从1B到8B），这是首个专为电信领域定制的语言模型。评估表明，这些模型在Tele-Eval测试集和电信文献任务上显著优于通用模型，同时保留了原有能力，有效避免了灾难性遗忘现象。
