原文摘要:
General purpose Large Language Models (LLM) such as the Generative Pretrained
Transformer (GPT) and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) have attracted much
attention in recent years. There is strong evidence that these models can
perform remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks. However,
how to leverage them to approach domain-specific use cases and drive value
remains an open question. In this work, we focus on a specific use case,
pharmaceutical manufacturing investigations, and propose that leveraging
historical records of manufacturing incidents and deviations in an organization
can be beneficial for addressing and closing new cases, or de-risking new
manufacturing campaigns. Using a small but diverse dataset of real
manufacturing deviations selected from different product lines, we evaluate and
quantify the power of three general purpose LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2)
in performing tasks related to the above goal. In particular, (1) the ability
of LLMs in automating the process of extracting specific information such as
root cause of a case from unstructured data, as well as (2) the possibility of
identifying similar or related deviations by performing semantic search on the
database of historical records are examined. While our results point to the
high accuracy of GPT-4 and Claude-2 in the information extraction task, we
discuss cases of complex interplay between the apparent reasoning and
hallucination behavior of LLMs as a risk factor. Furthermore, we show that
semantic search on vector embedding of deviation descriptions can be used to
identify similar records, such as those with a similar type of defect, with a
high level of accuracy. We discuss further improvements to enhance the accuracy
of similar record identification.

近年来，通用大语言模型（如生成式预训练变换模型GPT和Meta AI的大型语言模型LLaMA）引发了广泛关注。大量证据表明，这些模型在各类自然语言处理任务中表现卓越。然而，如何将其应用于特定领域场景并创造价值仍是一个开放性问题。本研究聚焦制药生产偏差调查这一具体场景，提出利用企业历史生产异常事件记录将有助于新案例的处置结案或降低新生产活动的风险。通过选取来自不同产品线的真实生产偏差数据（规模较小但多样性充分），我们系统评估并量化了三种通用大语言模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-4和Claude-2）在实现上述目标相关任务中的表现，具体包括：（1）从非结构化数据中自动提取案例根本原因等特定信息的能力；（2）通过对历史记录数据库进行语义搜索来识别相似或关联偏差的可能性。研究发现，虽然GPT-4和Claude-2在信息提取任务中准确率较高，但大语言模型表现出的推理能力与幻觉行为之间的复杂交互可能构成风险因素。此外，研究证明对偏差描述的向量嵌入进行语义搜索能以较高精度识别相似记录（如具有同类缺陷特征的案例）。本文还探讨了进一步提升相似记录识别准确率的改进方向。
