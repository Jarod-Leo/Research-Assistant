原文摘要:
Over the past decade, studies of naturalistic language processing where
participants are scanned while listening to continuous text have flourished.
Using word embeddings at first, then large language models, researchers have
created encoding models to analyze the brain signals. Presenting these models
with the same text as the participants allows to identify brain areas where
there is a significant correlation between the functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) time series and the ones predicted by the models' artificial
neurons. One intriguing finding from these studies is that they have revealed
highly symmetric bilateral activation patterns, somewhat at odds with the
well-known left lateralization of language processing. Here, we report analyses
of an fMRI dataset where we manipulate the complexity of large language models,
testing 28 pretrained models from 8 different families, ranging from 124M to
14.2B parameters. First, we observe that the performance of models in
predicting brain responses follows a scaling law, where the fit with brain
activity increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of parameters of
the model (and its performance on natural language processing tasks). Second,
although this effect is present in both hemispheres, it is stronger in the left
than in the right hemisphere. Specifically, the left-right difference in brain
correlation follows a scaling law with the number of parameters. This finding
reconciles computational analyses of brain activity using large language models
with the classic observation from aphasic patients showing left hemisphere
dominance for language.

过去十年间，自然语言处理的神经影像研究蓬勃发展——研究者通过在受试者聆听连续文本时进行脑部扫描，最初使用词嵌入技术，继而采用大语言模型构建编码模型来分析脑信号。当这些模型接收与受试者相同的文本输入时，研究者能通过功能磁共振成像（fMRI）时间序列与模型人工神经元预测序列之间的显著相关性定位特定脑区。这些研究揭示了一个有趣现象：它们呈现出高度对称的双侧激活模式，与语言加工左脑偏侧化的经典理论存在一定矛盾。本文通过分析一组fMRI实验数据，系统考察了28个预训练大语言模型（涵盖8个模型家族，参数量从1.24亿到142亿不等）的复杂度影响。首先发现模型预测脑反应的能力遵循缩放定律：其与大脑活动的拟合度随模型参数量的对数（及模型在自然语言处理任务中的表现）呈线性增长。其次，虽然这种效应在双侧大脑半球均存在，但左半球显著强于右半球——具体表现为大脑相关性左右差异值同样遵循参数量缩放定律。这一发现弥合了基于大语言模型的脑活动计算分析与失语症患者研究显示的左半球语言优势之间的理论分歧。
