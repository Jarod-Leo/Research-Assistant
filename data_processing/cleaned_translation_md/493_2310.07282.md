链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07282v2

原文摘要:
This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into applying large
language models, particularly on BioBERT, in healthcare. It begins with
thoroughly examining previous natural language processing (NLP) approaches in
healthcare, shedding light on the limitations and challenges these methods
face. Following that, this research explores the path that led to the
incorporation of BioBERT into healthcare applications, highlighting its
suitability for addressing the specific requirements of tasks related to
biomedical text mining. The analysis outlines a systematic methodology for
fine-tuning BioBERT to meet the unique needs of the healthcare domain. This
approach includes various components, including the gathering of data from a
wide range of healthcare sources, data annotation for tasks like identifying
medical entities and categorizing them, and the application of specialized
preprocessing techniques tailored to handle the complexities found in
biomedical texts. Additionally, the paper covers aspects related to model
evaluation, with a focus on healthcare benchmarks and functions like processing
of natural language in biomedical, question-answering, clinical document
classification, and medical entity recognition. It explores techniques to
improve the model's interpretability and validates its performance compared to
existing healthcare-focused language models. The paper thoroughly examines
ethical considerations, particularly patient privacy and data security. It
highlights the benefits of incorporating BioBERT into healthcare contexts,
including enhanced clinical decision support and more efficient information
retrieval. Nevertheless, it acknowledges the impediments and complexities of
this integration, encompassing concerns regarding data privacy, transparency,
resource-intensive requirements, and the necessity for model customization to
align with diverse healthcare domains.
