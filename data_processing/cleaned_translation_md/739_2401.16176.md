原文摘要:
The transformer architecture has shown remarkable success in various domains,
such as natural language processing and computer vision. When it comes to graph
learning, transformers are required not only to capture the interactions
between pairs of nodes but also to preserve graph structures connoting the
underlying relations and proximity between them, showing the expressive power
to capture different graph structures. Accordingly, various
structure-preserving graph transformers have been proposed and widely used for
various tasks, such as graph-level tasks in bioinformatics and
chemoinformatics. However, strategies related to graph structure preservation
have not been well organized and systematized in the literature. In this paper,
we provide a comprehensive overview of structure-preserving graph transformers
and generalize these methods from the perspective of their design objective.
First, we divide strategies into four main groups: node feature modulation,
context node sampling, graph rewriting, and transformer architecture
improvements. We then further divide the strategies according to the coverage
and goals of graph structure preservation. Furthermore, we also discuss
challenges and future directions for graph transformer models to preserve the
graph structure and understand the nature of graphs.

变压器架构在自然语言处理与计算机视觉等领域已展现出卓越成效。针对图学习任务，变压器模型不仅需捕获节点间的交互关系，更需保持蕴含底层关联性与邻近度的图结构特征，从而展现其刻画不同图结构的表达能力。基于此，各类结构保持型图变压器模型被相继提出，并广泛应用于生物信息学与化学信息学等领域的图级任务。然而，现有文献尚未对图结构保持策略进行系统化梳理与归纳。本文从设计目标出发，对结构保持型图变压器进行全面综述与方法论归纳：首先将现有策略划分为四大类——节点特征调制、上下文节点采样、图重构以及变压器架构改进；继而根据图结构保持的覆盖范围与目标进行二级分类；最后探讨了图变压器模型在结构保持与图本质理解方面面临的挑战与未来研究方向。
