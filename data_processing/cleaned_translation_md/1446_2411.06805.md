# AssistRAG: Boosting the Potential of Large Language Models with an Intelligent Information Assistant

原文摘要:
The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
natural language processing, but these models often generate factually
incorrect information, known as "hallucination". Initial retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) methods like the "Retrieve-Read" framework was inadequate for
complex reasoning tasks. Subsequent prompt-based RAG strategies and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods improved performance but required frequent retraining
and risked altering foundational LLM capabilities. To cope with these
challenges, we propose Assistant-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(AssistRAG), integrating an intelligent information assistant within LLMs. This
assistant manages memory and knowledge through tool usage, action execution,
memory building, and plan specification. Using a two-phase training approach,
Curriculum Assistant Learning and Reinforced Preference Optimization. AssistRAG
enhances information retrieval and decision-making. Experiments show AssistRAG
significantly outperforms benchmarks, especially benefiting less advanced LLMs,
by providing superior reasoning capabilities and accurate responses.

大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现显著推动了自然语言处理的发展，但这些模型常会生成与事实不符的错误信息，这种现象被称为"幻觉"。早期的检索增强生成（RAG）方法（如"检索-阅读"框架）难以应对复杂推理任务。后续基于提示的RAG策略和监督微调（SFT）方法虽提升了性能，但需要频繁重新训练，且可能改变基础LLM的核心能力。为应对这些挑战，我们提出基于智能助手的检索增强生成框架（AssistRAG），通过在LLM中集成信息处理助手。该助手通过工具调用、动作执行、记忆构建和计划制定来管理记忆与知识，采用两阶段训练方法——课程化助手学习与强化偏好优化，显著提升了信息检索与决策能力。实验表明AssistRAG在各项基准测试中表现优异，尤其能显著提升性能较弱LLM的推理能力与回答准确性。
