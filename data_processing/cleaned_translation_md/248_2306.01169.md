# Hybrid Long Document Summarization using C2F-FAR and ChatGPT: A Practical Study

原文摘要:
Text summarization is a downstream natural language processing (NLP) task
that challenges the understanding and generation capabilities of language
models. Considerable progress has been made in automatically summarizing short
texts, such as news articles, often leading to satisfactory results. However,
summarizing long documents remains a major challenge. This is due to the
complex contextual information in the text and the lack of open-source
benchmarking datasets and evaluation frameworks that can be used to develop and
test model performance. In this work, we use ChatGPT, the latest breakthrough
in the field of large language models (LLMs), together with the extractive
summarization model C2F-FAR (Coarse-to-Fine Facet-Aware Ranking) to propose a
hybrid extraction and summarization pipeline for long documents such as
business articles and books. We work with the world-renowned company
getAbstract AG and leverage their expertise and experience in professional book
summarization. A practical study has shown that machine-generated summaries can
perform at least as well as human-written summaries when evaluated using
current automated evaluation metrics. However, a closer examination of the
texts generated by ChatGPT through human evaluations has shown that there are
still critical issues in terms of text coherence, faithfulness, and style.
Overall, our results show that the use of ChatGPT is a very promising but not
yet mature approach for summarizing long documents and can at best serve as an
inspiration for human editors. We anticipate that our work will inform NLP
researchers about the extent to which ChatGPT's capabilities for summarizing
long documents overlap with practitioners' needs. Further work is needed to
test the proposed hybrid summarization pipeline, in particular involving GPT-4,
and to propose a new evaluation framework tailored to the task of summarizing
long documents.

文本摘要作为自然语言处理（NLP）的下游任务，对语言模型的理解与生成能力提出了双重挑战。当前针对新闻等短文本的自动摘要已取得显著进展，往往能产生令人满意的结果。然而长文档摘要仍面临重大挑战，这既源于文本中复杂的上下文信息，也由于缺乏可用于开发和测试模型性能的开源基准数据集与评估框架。本研究利用大语言模型（LLM）领域的最新突破成果ChatGPT，结合抽取式摘要模型C2F-FAR（从粗粒度到细粒度的多维度排序模型），针对商业文章和书籍等长文档提出了一种混合式抽取与生成摘要流程。我们与世界知名企业getAbstract AG合作，借鉴其在专业书籍摘要领域的丰富经验。实践研究表明，采用现有自动化评估指标时，机器生成摘要的质量至少不逊于人工撰写摘要。但通过人工评估对ChatGPT生成文本进行深入检视后，我们发现其在文本连贯性、事实忠实度和风格一致性方面仍存在关键缺陷。总体而言，研究结果表明使用ChatGPT进行长文档摘要是一种极具前景但尚未成熟的方法，目前至多能为人工编辑提供创作灵感。我们期望本研究成果能帮助NLP研究者理解ChatGPT的长文档摘要能力与实际应用需求的契合程度。未来需进一步测试提出的混合摘要流程（特别是结合GPT-4的版本），并需要针对长文档摘要任务设计专用的新型评估框架。
