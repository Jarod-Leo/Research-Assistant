原文摘要:
Recent advances in the performance of large language models (LLMs) have
sparked debate over whether, given sufficient training, high-level human
abilities emerge in such generic forms of artificial intelligence (AI). Despite
the exceptional performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks involving natural
language processing and reasoning, there has been sharp disagreement as to
whether their abilities extend to more creative human abilities. A core example
is the ability to interpret novel metaphors. Given the enormous and non curated
text corpora used to train LLMs, a serious obstacle to designing tests is the
requirement of finding novel yet high quality metaphors that are unlikely to
have been included in the training data. Here we assessed the ability of GPT4,
a state of the art large language model, to provide natural-language
interpretations of novel literary metaphors drawn from Serbian poetry and
translated into English. Despite exhibiting no signs of having been exposed to
these metaphors previously, the AI system consistently produced detailed and
incisive interpretations. Human judges, blind to the fact that an AI model was
involved, rated metaphor interpretations generated by GPT4 as superior to those
provided by a group of college students. In interpreting reversed metaphors,
GPT4, as well as humans, exhibited signs of sensitivity to the Gricean
cooperative principle. In addition, for several novel English poems GPT4
produced interpretations that were rated as excellent or good by a human
literary critic. These results indicate that LLMs such as GPT4 have acquired an
emergent ability to interpret complex metaphors, including those embedded in
novel poems.

近期，大型语言模型（LLM）的性能突破引发了一场争论：经过充分训练后，这种通用型人工智能（AI）是否能够涌现出高阶人类能力。尽管LLM在涉及自然语言处理和推理的广泛任务中表现卓越，但学界对其能力是否延伸至更具创造性的人类特质——例如解读新颖隐喻的核心能力——仍存在尖锐分歧。由于LLM训练所使用的海量文本语料未经人工筛选，设计测试面临严峻挑战：必须确保所选用的高质量新颖隐喻未被包含在训练数据中。本研究评估了顶尖LLM模型GPT-4对塞尔维亚诗歌英译版中文学隐喻的自然语言解读能力。尽管没有迹象表明AI系统曾接触过这些隐喻，它却持续产出细致深刻的解读。在不知晓AI参与的情况下，人类评审认为GPT-4生成的隐喻解读优于大学生对照组。在解读逆向隐喻时，GPT-4与人类均表现出对格莱斯合作原则的敏感性。此外，对于若干首原创英文诗歌，GPT-4生成的解读获得了专业文学评论家"优秀"或"良好"的评价。这些结果表明，以GPT-4为代表的LLM已涌现出解读复杂隐喻的能力，包括嵌入新诗中的隐喻。
