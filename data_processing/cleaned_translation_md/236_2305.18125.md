原文摘要:
The use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in engineering
education can provide valuable insights into the underlying processes involved
in generating text. While accessing these insights can be labor-intensive if
done manually, recent advances in NLP and large language models have made it a
realistic option for individuals. This study explores and evaluates a
combination of clustering, summarization, and prompting techniques to analyze
over 1,000 student essays in which students discussed their career interests.
The specific assignment prompted students to define and explain their career
goals as engineers. Using text embedding representations of student responses,
we clustered the responses together to identify thematically similar statements
from students. The clustered responses were then summarized to quickly identify
career interest themes. We also used a set of a priori codes about career
satisfaction and sectors to demonstrate an alternative approach to using these
generative text models to analyze student writing. The results of this study
demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of NLP techniques in engineering
education research. By automating the initial analysis of student essays,
researchers and educators can more efficiently and accurately identify key
themes and patterns in student writing. The methods presented in this paper
have broader applications for engineering education and research purposes
beyond analyzing student essays. By explaining these methods to the engineering
education community, readers can utilize them in their own contexts.

自然语言处理（NLP）技术在工程教育中的应用，能够为文本生成的内在过程提供有价值的洞察。虽然人工获取这些洞察可能耗时费力，但NLP与大型语言模型的最新进展已使其成为个人可实现的选项。本研究探索并评估了结合聚类、摘要生成与提示技术的分析方法，对千余篇学生论述职业兴趣的论文进行解析。该特定作业要求学生定义并阐释其作为工程师的职业目标。通过将学生回答转化为文本嵌入表示，我们对回答进行聚类以识别学生陈述中的主题相似性，继而通过摘要生成快速提炼职业兴趣主题。我们还采用了一套关于职业满意度与行业领域的先验编码，展示利用生成式文本模型分析学生写作的替代方法。研究结果证实了NLP技术在工程教育研究中的可行性与实用性。通过自动化完成学生论文的初步分析，研究者与教育者能更高效、准确地识别学生写作中的核心主题与模式。本文所述方法在工程教育与研究领域具有超越学生论文分析的广泛适用性，通过向工程教育界阐释这些方法，读者可在自身研究场景中加以运用。
