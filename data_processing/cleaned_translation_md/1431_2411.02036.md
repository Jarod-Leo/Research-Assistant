# Explainable cognitive decline detection in free dialogues with a Machine Learning approach based on pre-trained Large Language Models

原文摘要:
Cognitive and neurological impairments are very common, but only a small
proportion of affected individuals are diagnosed and treated, partly because of
the high costs associated with frequent screening. Detecting pre-illness stages
and analyzing the progression of neurological disorders through effective and
efficient intelligent systems can be beneficial for timely diagnosis and early
intervention. We propose using Large Language Models to extract features from
free dialogues to detect cognitive decline. These features comprise high-level
reasoning content-independent features (such as comprehension, decreased
awareness, increased distraction, and memory problems). Our solution comprises
(i) preprocessing, (ii) feature engineering via Natural Language Processing
techniques and prompt engineering, (iii) feature analysis and selection to
optimize performance, and (iv) classification, supported by automatic
explainability. We also explore how to improve Chatgpt's direct cognitive
impairment prediction capabilities using the best features in our models.
Evaluation metrics obtained endorse the effectiveness of a mixed approach
combining feature extraction with Chatgpt and a specialized Machine Learning
model to detect cognitive decline within free-form conversational dialogues
with older adults. Ultimately, our work may facilitate the development of an
inexpensive, non-invasive, and rapid means of detecting and explaining
cognitive decline.

认知与神经功能障碍极为普遍，但仅有少数患者能获得诊断和治疗，部分原因在于频繁筛查的高昂成本。通过高效智能系统检测疾病前兆并分析神经退行性疾病的进展，有助于实现及时诊断和早期干预。本研究提出利用大语言模型从自由对话中提取特征来识别认知衰退，这些特征包含与具体内容无关的高阶推理特征（如理解力下降、自我觉察减弱、注意力分散加剧及记忆障碍等）。我们的解决方案包含：（1）数据预处理；（2）通过自然语言处理技术和提示工程进行特征构建；（3）特征分析与筛选以优化性能；（4）辅以自动可解释性的分类模型。同时探索如何利用模型中的最佳特征提升ChatGPT直接预测认知障碍的能力。评估指标验证了混合方法的有效性——结合ChatGPT特征提取与专用机器学习模型，可在与老年人的自由对话中有效识别认知衰退。本研究最终有望推动开发一种低成本、非侵入性且能快速检测并解释认知衰退的解决方案。
