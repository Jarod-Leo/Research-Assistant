原文摘要:
Image processing is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims at
enhancing image quality and extracting essential features for subsequent vision
applications. Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individual
tasks and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon the
success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP),
there is a similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developing
large-scale models through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigm
shift reduces the reliance on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unified
model to deal with various tasks. However, these advances have predominantly
concentrated on high-level vision tasks, with less attention paid to low-level
vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a universal model for general
image processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, image
feature extraction tasks, etc. Our proposed framework, named PromptGIP, unifies
these diverse image processing tasks within a universal framework. Inspired by
NLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ a visual prompting question
answering paradigm. Specifically, we treat the input-output image pair as a
structured question-answer sentence, thereby reprogramming the image processing
task as a prompting QA problem. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domain
tasks using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for task-specific
finetuning. Our methodology offers a universal and adaptive solution to general
image processing. While PromptGIP has demonstrated a certain degree of
out-of-domain task generalization capability, further research is expected to
fully explore its more powerful emergent generalization.

图像处理是计算机视觉领域的一项基础任务，旨在提升图像质量并提取关键特征以供后续视觉应用。传统方法需要针对不同任务开发专用模型，且设计这类模型需具备特定领域的专业知识。受大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）中成功的启发，计算机视觉领域也出现了通过预训练和上下文学习开发大规模模型的趋势。这种范式转变降低了对专用模型的依赖，催生了能够处理多种任务的强大统一模型。然而，当前进展主要集中于高层视觉任务，对底层视觉任务的关注相对不足。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种通用图像处理模型，涵盖图像复原、图像增强、图像特征提取等任务。我们提出的PromptGIP框架将这些多样化任务统一在通用架构下，借鉴NLP中的问答技术，采用视觉提示问答范式：将输入-输出图像对视作结构化问答语句，从而将图像处理任务重构为提示问答问题。PromptGIP能根据提供的视觉提示执行跨领域任务，无需针对特定任务进行微调。该方法为通用图像处理提供了自适应解决方案。虽然PromptGIP已展现出一定程度的领域外任务泛化能力，但未来研究仍需进一步探索其更强大的涌现泛化特性。
