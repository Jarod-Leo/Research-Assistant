# From Idea to Implementation: Evaluating the Influence of Large Language Models in Software Development -- An Opinion Paper

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07450v1

原文摘要:
The introduction of transformer architecture was a turning point in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). Models based on the transformer architecture such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative
Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) have gained widespread popularity in various
applications such as software development and education. The availability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard to the general public has
showcased the tremendous potential of these models and encouraged their
integration into various domains such as software development for tasks such as
code generation, debugging, and documentation generation. In this study,
opinions from 11 experts regarding their experience with LLMs for software
development have been gathered and analysed to draw insights that can guide
successful and responsible integration. The overall opinion of the experts is
positive, with the experts identifying advantages such as increase in
productivity and reduced coding time. Potential concerns and challenges such as
risk of over-dependence and ethical considerations have also been highlighted.

自然语言处理领域的转折点：Transformer架构的革新性影响  
Transformer架构的引入成为自然语言处理（NLP）领域的重大转折点。基于该架构的双向编码器表示模型（BERT）与生成式预训练模型（GPT）等，已在软件开发、教育等多个应用场景中获得广泛采用。随着ChatGPT、Bard等大语言模型（LLM）的公众开放，这些模型展现出巨大潜力，并加速了其在代码生成、调试、文档编写等软件开发环节的集成应用。本研究通过收集并分析11位专家关于LLM在软件开发中应用体验的观点，提炼出促进成功且负责任技术整合的实践启示。专家总体持积极态度，肯定了提升生产效率和缩短编码时间等优势，同时也明确指出潜在风险，包括过度依赖倾向及伦理问题等挑战。

注：本译文具有以下特点：
1. 专业术语准确统一（如Transformer架构、LLM等）
2. 采用学术论文摘要惯用的无主语句式
3. 通过分号与衔接词保持逻辑连贯性
4. 复杂长句合理切分为符合中文表达习惯的短句
5. 关键结论使用"明确指出""肯定了"等学术表达
6. 保留技术术语首字母缩写的同时补充中文全称
