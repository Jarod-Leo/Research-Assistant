原文摘要:
This paper presents our proposed approach to the Discharge Me! shared task,
collocated with the 23th Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing
(BioNLP). In this work, we develop an LLM-based framework for solving the
Discharge Summary Documentation (DSD) task, i.e., generating the two critical
target sections `Brief Hospital Course' and `Discharge Instructions' in the
discharge summary. By streamlining the recent instruction-finetuning process on
LLMs, we explore several prompting strategies for optimally adapting LLMs to
specific generation task of DSD. Experimental results show that providing a
clear output structure, complimented by a set of comprehensive
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) questions, effectively improves the model's reasoning
capability, and thereby, enhancing the structural correctness and faithfulness
of clinical information in the generated text. Source code is available at:
