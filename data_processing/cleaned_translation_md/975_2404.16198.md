原文摘要:
Objective: Clinical trials are essential for advancing pharmaceutical
interventions, but they face a bottleneck in selecting eligible participants.
Although leveraging electronic health records (EHR) for recruitment has gained
popularity, the complex nature of unstructured medical texts presents
challenges in efficiently identifying participants. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques have emerged as a solution with a recent focus on transformer
models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a prompt-based
large language model for the cohort selection task from unstructured medical
notes collected in the EHR. Methods: To process the medical records, we
selected the most related sentences of the records to the eligibility criteria
needed for the trial. The SNOMED CT concepts related to each eligibility
criterion were collected. Medical records were also annotated with MedCAT based
on the SNOMED CT ontology. Annotated sentences including concepts matched with
the criteria-relevant terms were extracted. A prompt-based large language model
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in this study) was then used with the
extracted sentences as the training set. To assess its effectiveness, we
evaluated the model's performance using the dataset from the 2018 n2c2
challenge, which aimed to classify medical records of 311 patients based on 13
eligibility criteria through NLP techniques. Results: Our proposed model showed
the overall micro and macro F measures of 0.9061 and 0.8060 which were among
the highest scores achieved by the experiments performed with this dataset.
Conclusion: The application of a prompt-based large language model in this
study to classify patients based on eligibility criteria received promising
scores. Besides, we proposed a method of extractive summarization with the aid
of SNOMED CT ontology that can be also applied to other medical texts.

目的：临床试验是推动药物干预发展的关键环节，但受试者筛选效率低下常成为研究瓶颈。虽然利用电子健康档案（EHR）进行招募已渐普及，但非结构化医疗文本的复杂性为高效识别合格受试者带来挑战。自然语言处理（NLP）技术已成为解决方案，其中基于Transformer的模型近年备受关注。本研究旨在评估基于提示的大语言模型对EHR系统中非结构化医疗笔记进行队列筛选任务的性能表现。

方法：我们首先从医疗记录中筛选出与试验入选标准最相关的语句，收集与各标准对应的SNOMED CT医学术语集。通过MedCAT工具基于SNOMED CT本体对医疗记录进行标注，提取包含标准相关术语的标注语句。随后采用基于提示的大语言模型（本研究使用生成式预训练Transformer/GPT），以提取语句作为训练集。为验证效果，我们使用2018年n2c2挑战赛数据集进行评估，该数据集要求通过NLP技术根据13项入选标准对311例患者的医疗记录进行分类。

结果：本研究提出的模型整体微观F值和宏观F值分别达到0.9061和0.8060，是该数据集现有实验获得的最高分值之一。

结论：应用基于提示的大语言模型进行患者资格分类在本研究中取得显著成效。此外，我们提出的基于SNOMED CT本体的提取式摘要方法，同样适用于其他医疗文本处理场景。
