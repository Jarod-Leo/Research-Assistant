原文摘要:
Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial
intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional
methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging
subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in
Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs
are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks
and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based
judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging
field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output
perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore
LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to
judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and
highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable
insights and inspire future research in this promising research area. Paper
