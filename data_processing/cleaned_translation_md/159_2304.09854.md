原文摘要:
Visual segmentation seeks to partition images, video frames, or point clouds
into multiple segments or groups. This technique has numerous real-world
applications, such as autonomous driving, image editing, robot sensing, and
medical analysis. Over the past decade, deep learning-based methods have made
remarkable strides in this area. Recently, transformers, a type of neural
network based on self-attention originally designed for natural language
processing, have considerably surpassed previous convolutional or recurrent
approaches in various vision processing tasks. Specifically, vision
transformers offer robust, unified, and even simpler solutions for various
segmentation tasks. This survey provides a thorough overview of
transformer-based visual segmentation, summarizing recent advancements. We
first review the background, encompassing problem definitions, datasets, and
prior convolutional methods. Next, we summarize a meta-architecture that
unifies all recent transformer-based approaches. Based on this
meta-architecture, we examine various method designs, including modifications
to the meta-architecture and associated applications. We also present several
closely related settings, including 3D point cloud segmentation, foundation
model tuning, domain-aware segmentation, efficient segmentation, and medical
segmentation. Additionally, we compile and re-evaluate the reviewed methods on
several well-established datasets. Finally, we identify open challenges in this
field and propose directions for future research. The project page can be found
