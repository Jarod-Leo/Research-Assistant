# Narratives from GPT-derived Networks of News, and a link to Financial Markets Dislocations

原文摘要:
Starting from a corpus of economic articles from The Wall Street Journal, we
present a novel systematic way to analyse news content that evolves over time.
We leverage on state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques (i.e.
GPT3.5) to extract the most important entities of each article available, and
aggregate co-occurrence of entities in a related graph at the weekly level.
Network analysis techniques and fuzzy community detection are tested on the
proposed set of graphs, and a framework is introduced that allows systematic
but interpretable detection of topics and narratives. In parallel, we propose
to consider the sentiment around main entities of an article as a more accurate
proxy for the overall sentiment of such piece of text, and describe a
case-study to motivate this choice. Finally, we design features that
characterise the type and structure of news within each week, and map them to
moments of financial markets dislocations. The latter are identified as dates
with unusually high volatility across asset classes, and we find quantitative
evidence that they relate to instances of high entropy in the high-dimensional
space of interconnected news. This result further motivates the pursued efforts
to provide a novel framework for the systematic analysis of narratives within
news.

本研究以《华尔街日报》经济类文章为语料库，提出了一种分析时序演变新闻内容的新型系统方法。我们运用前沿自然语言处理技术（GPT3.5）提取每篇文章的核心实体，并在周度层面构建实体共现关系图谱。通过测试网络分析技术与模糊社区检测方法，我们开发出兼具系统性和可解释性的主题叙事检测框架。

研究创新性地提出：以文章核心实体的情感倾向作为全文情感更精准的代理指标，并通过案例研究验证该方法的合理性。此外，我们设计了表征每周新闻类型与结构的特征指标，并将其映射至金融市场异常波动时段——这些时段通过跨资产类别异常波动率识别。量化分析表明，这些市场动荡期与高维新闻网络中的信息熵峰值存在显著关联。

该发现为构建新闻叙事系统分析框架提供了实证支持，突显了本研究在金融信息挖掘领域的应用价值。
