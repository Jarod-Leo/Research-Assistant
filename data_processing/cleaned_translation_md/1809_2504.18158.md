# E-InMeMo: Enhanced Prompting for Visual In-Context Learning

原文摘要:
Large-scale models trained on extensive datasets have become the standard due
to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks. In-context learning
(ICL), widely used in natural language processing, leverages these models by
providing task-specific prompts without modifying their parameters. This
paradigm is increasingly being adapted for computer vision, where models
receive an input-output image pair, known as an in-context pair, alongside a
query image to illustrate the desired output. However, the success of visual
ICL largely hinges on the quality of these prompts. To address this, we propose
Enhanced Instruct Me More (E-InMeMo), a novel approach that incorporates
learnable perturbations into in-context pairs to optimize prompting. Through
extensive experiments on standard vision tasks, E-InMeMo demonstrates superior
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it improves mIoU
scores by 7.99 for foreground segmentation and by 17.04 for single object
detection when compared to the baseline without learnable prompts. These
results highlight E-InMeMo as a lightweight yet effective strategy for
enhancing visual ICL. Code is publicly available at:
