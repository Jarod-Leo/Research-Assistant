原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across various
natural language processing tasks but suffer from immense computational and
memory demands, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments.
To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation
Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving
compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB
models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector
quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and
unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that
NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that
NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. These results
suggest commonalities between these compression paradigms that could inspire
future work. Our code is available at
