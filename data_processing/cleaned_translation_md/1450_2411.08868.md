# CamemBERT 2.0: A Smarter French Language Model Aged to Perfection

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08868v1

原文摘要:
French language models, such as CamemBERT, have been widely adopted across
industries for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, with models like
CamemBERT seeing over 4 million downloads per month. However, these models face
challenges due to temporal concept drift, where outdated training data leads to
a decline in performance, especially when encountering new topics and
terminology. This issue emphasizes the need for updated models that reflect
current linguistic trends. In this paper, we introduce two new versions of the
CamemBERT base model-CamemBERTav2 and CamemBERTv2-designed to address these
challenges. CamemBERTav2 is based on the DeBERTaV3 architecture and makes use
of the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) objective for better contextual
understanding, while CamemBERTv2 is built on RoBERTa, which uses the Masked
Language Modeling (MLM) objective. Both models are trained on a significantly
larger and more recent dataset with longer context length and an updated
tokenizer that enhances tokenization performance for French. We evaluate the
performance of these models on both general-domain NLP tasks and
domain-specific applications, such as medical field tasks, demonstrating their
versatility and effectiveness across a range of use cases. Our results show
that these updated models vastly outperform their predecessors, making them
valuable tools for modern NLP systems. All our new models, as well as
intermediate checkpoints, are made openly available on Huggingface.

法语语言模型（如CamemBERT）已在自然语言处理（NLP）领域获得广泛应用，其中CamemBERT等模型的月下载量超过400万次。然而这些模型面临时间概念漂移的挑战——陈旧的训练数据会导致性能下降，尤其在处理新兴话题和术语时表现明显。这一问题凸显了需要能反映当前语言趋势的更新版模型。本文推出CamemBERT基础模型的两个新版本：CamemBERTav2和CamemBERTv2，旨在解决上述挑战。其中CamemBERTav2基于DeBERTaV3架构，采用替换标记检测（RTD）目标以提升上下文理解能力；CamemBERTv2则基于RoBERTa架构，使用掩码语言建模（MLM）目标。两个模型均在显著扩增的最新数据集上训练，具有更长的上下文窗口，并采用能提升法语分词性能的更新版分词器。我们通过在通用NLP任务和医疗领域等专业场景的测试，证明了该系列模型在多类应用中的优异性能。实验结果表明，这些新版模型性能远超前代，已成为现代NLP系统的有力工具。所有新模型及中间检查点均已开源发布于Huggingface平台。
