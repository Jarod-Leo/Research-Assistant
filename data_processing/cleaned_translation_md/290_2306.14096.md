原文摘要:
Entity-level fine-grained sentiment analysis in the financial domain is a
crucial subtask of sentiment analysis and currently faces numerous challenges.
The primary challenge stems from the lack of high-quality and large-scale
annotated corpora specifically designed for financial text sentiment analysis,
which in turn limits the availability of data necessary for developing
effective text processing techniques. Recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance in natural language
processing tasks, primarily centered around language pattern matching. In this
paper, we propose a novel and extensive Chinese fine-grained financial
sentiment analysis dataset, FinChina SA, for enterprise early warning. We
thoroughly evaluate and experiment with well-known existing open-source LLMs
using our dataset. We firmly believe that our dataset will serve as a valuable
resource to advance the exploration of real-world financial sentiment analysis
tasks, which should be the focus of future research. The FinChina SA dataset is
publicly available at
