# Exploring the Feasibility of ChatGPT for Event Extraction

原文摘要:
Event extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing that
involves identifying and extracting information about events mentioned in text.
However, it is a challenging task due to the lack of annotated data, which is
expensive and time-consuming to obtain. The emergence of large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT provides an opportunity to solve language tasks with
simple prompts without the need for task-specific datasets and fine-tuning.
While ChatGPT has demonstrated impressive results in tasks like machine
translation, text summarization, and question answering, it presents challenges
when used for complex tasks like event extraction. Unlike other tasks, event
extraction requires the model to be provided with a complex set of instructions
defining all event types and their schemas. To explore the feasibility of
ChatGPT for event extraction and the challenges it poses, we conducted a series
of experiments. Our results show that ChatGPT has, on average, only 51.04% of
the performance of a task-specific model such as EEQA in long-tail and complex
scenarios. Our usability testing experiments indicate that ChatGPT is not
robust enough, and continuous refinement of the prompt does not lead to stable
performance improvements, which can result in a poor user experience. Besides,
ChatGPT is highly sensitive to different prompt styles.

事件抽取是自然语言处理中的一项基础任务，旨在识别并提取文本中提及的事件信息。然而由于标注数据获取成本高、耗时长且资源匮乏，该任务一直面临严峻挑战。以ChatGPT为代表的大语言模型（LLMs）的出现为语言任务提供了新的解决范式——仅需简单提示即可完成任务，无需特定任务数据集和模型微调。虽然ChatGPT在机器翻译、文本摘要和问答等任务中表现卓越，但在事件抽取这类复杂任务中仍存在明显局限。不同于其他任务，事件抽取需要模型理解包含所有事件类型及其模式定义的复杂指令集。为探究ChatGPT在事件抽取任务中的可行性及挑战，我们开展了一系列实验。结果表明：在长尾复杂场景下，ChatGPT平均仅能达到EEQA等专用模型51.04%的性能水平。可用性测试实验显示，ChatGPT的鲁棒性不足，持续优化提示词并不能带来稳定的性能提升，可能导致较差的用户体验。此外，该模型对不同提示风格的敏感性极高。
