原文摘要:
In contemporary society, the issue of psychological health has become
increasingly prominent, characterized by the diversification, complexity, and
universality of mental disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), currently
the most influential and clinically effective psychological treatment method
with no side effects, has limited coverage and poor quality in most countries.
In recent years, researches on the recognition and intervention of emotional
disorders using large language models (LLMs) have been validated, providing new
possibilities for psychological assistance therapy. However, are LLMs truly
possible to conduct cognitive behavioral therapy? Many concerns have been
raised by mental health experts regarding the use of LLMs for therapy. Seeking
to answer this question, we collected real CBT corpus from online video
websites, designed and conducted a targeted automatic evaluation framework
involving the evaluation of emotion tendency of generated text, structured
dialogue pattern and proactive inquiry ability. For emotion tendency, we
calculate the emotion tendency score of the CBT dialogue text generated by each
model. For structured dialogue pattern, we use a diverse range of automatic
evaluation metrics to compare speaking style, the ability to maintain
consistency of topic and the use of technology in CBT between different models
. As for inquiring to guide the patient, we utilize PQA (Proactive Questioning
Ability) metric. We also evaluated the CBT ability of the LLM after integrating
a CBT knowledge base to explore the help of introducing additional knowledge to
enhance the model's CBT counseling ability. Four LLM variants with excellent
performance on natural language processing are evaluated, and the experimental
result shows the great potential of LLMs in psychological counseling realm,
especially after combining with other technological means.

在当代社会，心理健康问题日益凸显，表现为精神障碍的多样化、复杂化和普遍化特征。认知行为疗法（CBT）作为当前最具影响力且临床有效、无副作用的心理治疗方法，在多数国家存在覆盖范围有限、服务质量欠佳的问题。近年来，利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行情绪障碍识别与干预的研究得到验证，为心理辅助治疗提供了新的可能性。但大语言模型是否真能实施认知行为治疗？心理健康专家对其应用提出了诸多质疑。为探究这一问题，我们从在线视频网站收集真实CBT语料，设计并实施了针对性自动评估框架，涵盖生成文本的情感倾向评估、结构化对话模式及主动询问能力三大维度。针对情感倾向，计算各模型生成CBT对话文本的情感倾向得分；针对结构化对话模式，采用多样化自动评估指标比较不同模型在说话风格、话题连贯性维持及CBT技术运用等方面的表现；在引导患者的主动询问能力方面，采用PQA（主动提问能力）指标进行量化。我们还评估了整合CBT知识库后LLM的咨询能力，以探究引入外部知识对增强模型CBT辅导能力的助益。实验对四种在自然语言处理领域表现优异的LLM变体进行评估，结果表明大语言模型在心理咨询领域具有巨大潜力，尤其是在结合其他技术手段后表现更为突出。
