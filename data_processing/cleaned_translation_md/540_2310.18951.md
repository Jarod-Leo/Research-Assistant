原文摘要:
The Ecological Civilization Pattern Recommendation System (ECPRS) aims to
recommend suitable ecological civilization patterns for target regions,
promoting sustainable development and reducing regional disparities. However,
the current representative recommendation methods are not suitable for
recommending ecological civilization patterns in a geographical context. There
are two reasons for this. Firstly, regions have spatial heterogeneity, and the
(ECPRS)needs to consider factors like climate, topography, vegetation, etc., to
recommend civilization patterns adapted to specific ecological environments,
ensuring the feasibility and practicality of the recommendations. Secondly, the
abstract features of the ecological civilization patterns in the real world
have not been fully utilized., resulting in poor richness in their embedding
representations and consequently, lower performance of the recommendation
system. Considering these limitations, we propose the ECPR-MML method.
Initially, based on the novel method UGPIG, we construct a knowledge graph to
extract regional representations incorporating spatial heterogeneity features.
Following that, inspired by the significant progress made by Large Language
Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), we employ
Large LLMs to generate multimodal features for ecological civilization patterns
in the form of text and images. We extract and integrate these multimodal
features to obtain semantically rich representations of ecological
civilization. Through extensive experiments, we validate the performance of our
ECPR-MML model. Our results show that F1@5 is 2.11% higher compared to
state-of-the-art models, 2.02% higher than NGCF, and 1.16% higher than UGPIG.
Furthermore, multimodal data can indeed enhance recommendation performance.
However, the data generated by LLM is not as effective as real data to a
certain extent.

生态文明模式推荐系统（ECPRS）旨在为目标区域推荐适宜的生态文明发展模式，从而促进可持续发展并缩小地区差异。然而，当前具有代表性的推荐方法并不适用于地理场景下的生态文明模式推荐，主要原因有二：其一，区域具有空间异质性特征，ECPRS需综合考虑气候、地形、植被等因素，才能推荐适应当地生态环境的文明模式，确保建议的可行性与实用性；其二，现实世界中生态文明模式的抽象特征尚未得到充分利用，导致其嵌入表示丰富性不足，进而影响推荐系统的性能表现。针对这些局限性，我们提出ECPR-MML方法：首先基于创新方法UGPIG构建知识图谱，提取融合空间异质性特征的区域表征；随后受大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理（NLP）领域重大进展的启发，采用LLM生成以文本和图像形式呈现的生态文明模式多模态特征，通过提取与融合这些特征获得语义丰富的生态文明表征。经过大量实验验证，我们的ECPR-MML模型性能显著优于现有技术——F1@5指标较最优基线模型提升2.11%，较NGCF高2.02%，较UGPIG高1.16%。实验同时证明：多模态数据确实能提升推荐性能，但LLM生成的数据在一定程度上仍逊色于真实数据。
