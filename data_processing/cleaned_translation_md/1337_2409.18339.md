原文摘要:
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great
success in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to their
cognitive intelligence, exploring their capabilities in emotional intelligence
is also crucial, as it enables more natural and empathetic conversational AI.
Recent studies have shown LLMs' capability in recognizing emotions, but they
often focus on single emotion labels and overlook the complex and ambiguous
nature of human emotions. This study is the first to address this gap by
exploring the potential of LLMs in recognizing ambiguous emotions, leveraging
their strong generalization capabilities and in-context learning. We design
zero-shot and few-shot prompting and incorporate past dialogue as context
information for ambiguous emotion recognition. Experiments conducted using
three datasets indicate significant potential for LLMs in recognizing ambiguous
emotions, and highlight the substantial benefits of including context
information. Furthermore, our findings indicate that LLMs demonstrate a high
degree of effectiveness in recognizing less ambiguous emotions and exhibit
potential for identifying more ambiguous emotions, paralleling human perceptual
capabilities.

近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）诸多任务中取得了显著成功。除了认知智能外，探索其在情感智能方面的能力同样至关重要，这将推动对话式AI实现更自然、更具共情力的交互。现有研究虽已证明LLMs具备情绪识别能力，但多聚焦于单一情绪标签，忽视了人类情感复杂且模糊的本质。本研究首次通过利用LLMs强大的泛化能力和上下文学习优势，系统探索其在模糊情绪识别方面的潜力。我们设计了零样本和小样本提示策略，并引入历史对话作为上下文信息来辅助模糊情绪识别。基于三个数据集的实验表明：LLMs在模糊情绪识别方面展现出显著潜力，上下文信息的引入能带来实质性提升。此外，研究发现LLMs对明确情绪的识别效率接近人类水平，在识别高模糊情绪时也表现出与人类感知能力相似的发展潜力。
