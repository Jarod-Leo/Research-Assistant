原文摘要:
Knowledge tagging for questions is vital in modern intelligent educational
applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question
recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these
annotations have been performed by pedagogical experts, as the task demands not
only a deep semantic understanding of question stems and knowledge definitions
but also a strong ability to link problem-solving logic with relevant knowledge
concepts. With the advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP)
algorithms, such as pre-trained language models and large language models
(LLMs), pioneering studies have explored automating the knowledge tagging
process using various machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate
the use of a multi-agent system to address the limitations of previous
algorithms, particularly in handling complex cases involving intricate
knowledge definitions and strict numerical constraints. By demonstrating its
superior performance on the publicly available math question knowledge tagging
dataset, MathKnowCT, we highlight the significant potential of an LLM-based
multi-agent system in overcoming the challenges that previous methods have
encountered. Finally, through an in-depth discussion of the implications of
automating knowledge tagging, we underscore the promising results of deploying
LLM-based algorithms in educational contexts.
