原文摘要:
Autoregressive (AR) modeling has achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing by enabling models to generate text with coherence and
contextual understanding through next token prediction. Recently, in image
generation, VAR proposes scale-wise autoregressive modeling, which extends the
next token prediction to the next scale prediction, preserving the 2D structure
of images. However, VAR encounters two primary challenges: (1) its complex and
rigid scale design limits generalization in next scale prediction, and (2) the
generator's dependence on a discrete tokenizer with the same complex scale
structure restricts modularity and flexibility in updating the tokenizer. To
address these limitations, we introduce FlowAR, a general next scale prediction
method featuring a streamlined scale design, where each subsequent scale is
simply double the previous one. This eliminates the need for VAR's intricate
multi-scale residual tokenizer and enables the use of any off-the-shelf
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Our simplified design enhances generalization in
next scale prediction and facilitates the integration of Flow Matching for
high-quality image synthesis. We validate the effectiveness of FlowAR on the
challenging ImageNet-256 benchmark, demonstrating superior generation
performance compared to previous methods. Codes will be available at
