原文摘要:
The influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly growing, automating
more jobs over time. Assessing the fairness of LLMs is crucial due to their
expanding impact. Studies reveal the reflection of societal norms and biases in
LLMs, which creates a risk of propagating societal stereotypes in downstream
tasks. Many studies on bias in LLMs focus on gender bias in various NLP
applications. However, there's a gap in research on bias in emotional
attributes, despite the close societal link between emotion and gender. This
gap is even larger for low-resource languages like Bangla. Historically, women
are associated with emotions like empathy, fear, and guilt, while men are
linked to anger, bravado, and authority. This pattern reflects societal norms
in Bangla-speaking regions. We offer the first thorough investigation of
gendered emotion attribution in Bangla for both closed and open source LLMs in
this work. Our aim is to elucidate the intricate societal relationship between
gender and emotion specifically within the context of Bangla. We have been
successful in showing the existence of gender bias in the context of emotions
in Bangla through analytical methods and also show how emotion attribution
changes on the basis of gendered role selection in LLMs. All of our resources
including code and data are made publicly available to support future research
on Bangla NLP.

大型语言模型（LLMs）的影响力正在快速增长，逐步自动化更多工作岗位。鉴于其日益扩大的影响范围，评估LLMs的公平性至关重要。研究表明，LLMs会反映社会规范与偏见，这导致其在下游任务中传播社会刻板印象的风险。现有关于LLMs偏见的研究多集中于各类NLP应用中的性别偏见，然而在情感属性偏见方面的研究存在空白——尽管情感与性别在社会中具有紧密关联。对于孟加拉语等低资源语言，这一研究缺口更为显著。从社会认知来看，女性传统上被赋予共情、恐惧、愧疚等情感特质，而男性则常与愤怒、逞勇、权威等特征相关联，这种模式在孟加拉语地区的社会规范中尤为明显。本研究首次对孟加拉语封闭/开源LLMs中的性别化情感归因进行了系统考察，旨在揭示孟加拉语语境下性别与情感之间复杂的社会关联。我们通过分析方法成功证实了孟加拉语LLMs存在情感维度的性别偏见，并揭示了基于性别化角色选择的情感归因变化规律。所有研究资源（包括代码与数据）均已公开，以支持未来孟加拉语NLP研究。
