原文摘要:
Recent progress in deep learning and natural language processing has given
rise to powerful models that are primarily trained on a cloze-like task and
show some evidence of having access to substantial linguistic information,
including some constructional knowledge. This groundbreaking discovery presents
an exciting opportunity for a synergistic relationship between computational
methods and Construction Grammar research. In this chapter, we explore three
distinct approaches to the interplay between computational methods and
Construction Grammar: (i) computational methods for text analysis, (ii)
computational Construction Grammar, and (iii) deep learning models, with a
particular focus on language models. We touch upon the first two approaches as
a contextual foundation for the use of computational methods before providing
an accessible, yet comprehensive overview of deep learning models, which also
addresses reservations construction grammarians may have. Additionally, we
delve into experiments that explore the emergence of constructionally relevant
information within these models while also examining the aspects of
Construction Grammar that may pose challenges for these models. This chapter
aims to foster collaboration between researchers in the fields of natural
language processing and Construction Grammar. By doing so, we hope to pave the
way for new insights and advancements in both these fields.

深度学习与自然语言处理领域的最新进展催生出一批强大模型，这些模型主要通过类完形填空任务进行训练，并展现出获取丰富语言学知识（包括构式知识）的能力。这一突破性发现为计算方法与构式语法研究之间的协同合作创造了激动人心的机遇。本章将探讨计算方法与构式语法交互作用的三种路径：（1）面向文本分析的计算方法；（2）计算构式语法；（3）以语言模型为核心的深度学习模型。在深入剖析深度学习模型之前，我们先以前两种方法作为计算方法应用的背景铺垫，随后对深度学习模型进行既通俗易懂又全面系统的概述，同时回应构式语法学者可能存在的疑虑。我们进一步通过实验探究这些模型中构式相关信息的涌现现象，并分析构式语法中可能对这些模型构成挑战的要素。本章旨在促进自然语言处理与构式语法领域研究者的协作，从而为这两个领域开拓新的研究视野与进展路径。
