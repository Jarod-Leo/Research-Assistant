原文摘要:
Full waveform inversion (FWI) is used to reconstruct the physical properties
of subsurface media which plays an important role in seismic exploration.
However, the precision of FWI is seriously affected by the absence or
inaccuracy of low-frequency information. Therefore, reconstructing the
low-frequency signals accurately is highly significant in seismic data
processing. Low-frequency extrapolation of seismic records can be approached as
a deep learning regression problem. Thus, to obtain low-frequency information
from band-limited seismic records, a novel network structure called
low-frequency extrapolation transformer (LFET) is proposed to construct the
nonlinear mapping relationship between the data missing low-frequency and
low-frequency data in a supervised learning approach, which is inspired by the
transformer model widely used in natural language processing (NLP). We apply
multi-head self-attention (MSA) modules to model the remote dependencies of
seismic data. Based on this, we introduce a shifted window partitioning
approach to reduce the calculating amount. Due to the field data are not
suitable for supervised learning, we generate synthetic seismic records using
submodels selected from the benchmark Marmousi model as training data whose
characteristics are similar to that of the field data. A single trace of
synthetic band-limited seismic data in the time domain is used as the input
data, and the parameters of LFET are updated based on the errors between the
predicted trace and the corresponding label. The experimental results on the
data generated by different models, different wavelets, and different kinds of
field marine data demonstrate the feasibility and generalization of the
proposed method. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy with
lower computational expense than the traditional CNN method.

全波形反演（FWI）是重建地下介质物理属性的重要技术，在地震勘探中具有关键作用。然而低频信息的缺失或失真会严重影响FWI的精度，因此准确重构低频信号对地震数据处理至关重要。将地震记录的低频外推视为深度学习回归问题，受自然语言处理（NLP）中广泛应用的Transformer模型启发，本文提出一种新型低频外推Transformer网络（LFET），通过监督学习构建缺失低频数据与完整低频数据间的非线性映射关系。我们采用多头自注意力（MSA）模块建模地震数据的远程依赖性，并引入滑动窗口分割策略以降低计算量。鉴于实际野外数据不适合监督学习，我们选取Marmousi标准模型子集生成合成地震记录作为训练数据，其特性与野外数据相似。以时间域单道带限合成地震数据作为输入，根据预测道与标签道的误差更新LFET参数。在不同模型数据、不同子波及多种海上实际数据的测试结果表明，该方法具有可行性和泛化能力。与传统CNN方法相比，所提方法以更低计算成本获得了更高精度。
