原文摘要:
Natural language processing (NLP) has significantly influenced scientific
domains beyond human language, including protein engineering, where pre-trained
protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success. However,
interdisciplinary adoption remains limited due to challenges in data
collection, task benchmarking, and application. This work presents
VenusFactory, a versatile engine that integrates biological data retrieval,
standardized task benchmarking, and modular fine-tuning of PLMs. VenusFactory
supports both computer science and biology communities with choices of both a
command-line execution and a Gradio-based no-code interface, integrating $40+$
protein-related datasets and $40+$ popular PLMs. All implementations are
open-sourced on
