原文摘要:
Dialogue state tracking (DST) is evaluated by exact matching methods, which
rely on large amounts of labeled data and ignore semantic consistency, leading
to over-evaluation. Currently, leveraging large language models (LLM) in
evaluating natural language processing tasks has achieved promising results.
However, using LLM for DST evaluation is still under explored. In this paper,
we propose a two-dimensional zero-shot evaluation method for DST using GPT-4,
which divides the evaluation into two dimensions: accuracy and completeness.
Furthermore, we also design two manual reasoning paths in prompting to further
improve the accuracy of evaluation. Experimental results show that our method
achieves better performance compared to the baselines, and is consistent with
traditional exact matching based methods.

本文提出了一种基于GPT-4的对话状态追踪（DST）双维度零样本评估方法。当前DST领域普遍采用精确匹配评估方式，这种方法既依赖大量标注数据，又忽视了语义一致性，容易导致评估结果虚高。虽然大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理任务评估中已展现出良好效果，但其在DST评估中的应用仍待探索。我们创新性地将评估分解为准确性和完整性两个维度，并通过设计双重人工推理路径的提示策略进一步提升评估精度。实验表明，该方法不仅显著优于基线模型，与传统精确匹配评估结果也保持较高一致性。
