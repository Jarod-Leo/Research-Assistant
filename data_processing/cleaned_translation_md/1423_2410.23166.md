原文摘要:
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new
possibilities for automating the proposal of innovative scientific ideas. This
process involves two key phases: literature retrieval and idea generation.
However, existing approaches often fall short due to their reliance on
keyword-based search tools during the retrieval phase, which neglects crucial
semantic information and frequently results in incomplete retrieval outcomes.
Similarly, in the idea generation phase, current methodologies tend to depend
solely on the internal knowledge of LLMs or metadata from retrieved papers,
thereby overlooking significant valuable insights contained within the full
texts. To address these limitations, we introduce SciPIP, an innovative
framework designed to enhance the LLM-based proposal of scientific ideas
through improvements in both literature retrieval and idea generation. Our
approach begins with the construction of a comprehensive literature database
that supports advanced retrieval based not only on keywords but also on
semantics and citation relationships. This is complemented by the introduction
of a multi-granularity retrieval algorithm aimed at ensuring more thorough and
exhaustive retrieval results. For the idea generation phase, we propose a
dual-path framework that effectively integrates both the content of retrieved
papers and the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs. This integration
significantly boosts the novelty, feasibility, and practical value of proposed
ideas. Our experiments, conducted across various domains such as natural
language processing and computer vision, demonstrate SciPIP's capability to
generate a multitude of innovative and useful ideas. These findings underscore
SciPIP's potential as a valuable tool for researchers seeking to advance their
fields with groundbreaking concepts.

大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展为自动化生成创新科学构想开辟了新途径。该过程包含两个关键阶段：文献检索与创意生成。然而现有方法存在明显缺陷——检索阶段过度依赖基于关键词的搜索工具，忽视关键语义信息，常导致检索结果不完整；同样在创意生成阶段，现有方法仅利用LLMs内部知识或检索论文的元数据，未能充分挖掘全文蕴含的重要价值。为突破这些局限，我们提出创新框架SciPIP，通过改进文献检索和创意生成双环节来优化基于LLMs的科学构想提案。我们的方案首先构建支持多维检索的文献数据库，不仅支持关键词检索，还涵盖语义关联与引文网络分析，并配套提出多粒度检索算法以确保更全面彻底的检索结果。针对创意生成阶段，我们设计双路径框架，有机整合检索论文内容与LLMs的广博内部知识，显著提升生成构想的新颖性、可行性和实用价值。在自然语言处理、计算机视觉等领域的实验表明，SciPIP能持续产出大量创新且实用的研究构想。这些发现印证了SciPIP作为科研辅助工具的潜力，可帮助研究者通过突破性概念推动学科发展。
