# Taught by the Internet, Exploring Bias in OpenAIs GPT3

链接: http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02428v1

原文摘要:
This research delves into the current literature on bias in Natural Language
Processing Models and the techniques proposed to mitigate the problem of bias,
including why it is important to tackle bias in the first place. Additionally,
these techniques are further analysed in the light of newly developed models
that tower in size over past editions. To achieve those aims, the authors of
this paper conducted their research on GPT3 by OpenAI, the largest NLP model
available to consumers today. With 175 billion parameters in contrast to BERTs
340 million, GPT3 is the perfect model to test the common pitfalls of NLP
models. Tests were conducted through the development of an Applicant Tracking
System using GPT3. For the sake of feasibility and time constraints, the tests
primarily focused on gender bias, rather than all or multiple types of bias.
Finally, current mitigation techniques are considered and tested to measure
their degree of functionality.

本研究深入探讨了当前关于自然语言处理（NLP）模型偏见问题的文献，系统梳理了针对偏见缓解提出的各类技术方法，并阐释了解决偏见问题的根本重要性。在此基础上，研究者结合最新开发的超大规模模型（其参数量远超早期版本），对这些技术方案进行了进一步分析验证。为实现研究目标，本文作者以OpenAI开发的GPT-3——当前公开可用的最大规模NLP模型（拥有1750亿参数，相较BERT的3.4亿参数具有数量级优势）——作为研究对象，通过开发基于GPT-3的申请人追踪系统展开测试。鉴于可行性及时效性限制，测试主要聚焦于性别偏见而非多维度偏见检测。研究最终对现有偏见缓解技术进行了功能性评估测试，量化分析了其实际效用程度。
