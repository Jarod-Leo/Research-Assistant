# Rewriting the Script: Adapting Text Instructions for Voice Interaction

原文摘要:
Voice assistants have sharply risen in popularity in recent years, but their
use has been limited mostly to simple applications like music, hands-free
search, or control of internet-of-things devices. What would it take for voice
assistants to guide people through more complex tasks? In our work, we study
the limitations of the dominant approach voice assistants take to complex task
guidance: reading aloud written instructions. Using recipes as an example, we
observe twelve participants cook at home with a state-of-the-art voice
assistant. We learn that the current approach leads to nine challenges,
including obscuring the bigger picture, overwhelming users with too much
information, and failing to communicate affordances. Instructions delivered by
a voice assistant are especially difficult because they cannot be skimmed as
easily as written instructions. Alexa in particular did not surface crucial
details to the user or answer questions well. We draw on our observations to
propose eight ways in which voice assistants can ``rewrite the script'' --
summarizing, signposting, splitting, elaborating, volunteering, reordering,
redistributing, and visualizing -- to transform written sources into forms that
are readily communicated through spoken conversation. We conclude with a vision
of how modern advancements in natural language processing can be leveraged for
intelligent agents to guide users effectively through complex tasks.

近年来，语音助手的普及度急剧上升，但其应用场景大多局限于音乐播放、免提搜索或物联网设备控制等简单功能。若要让语音助手引导用户完成更复杂的任务，需要哪些突破？本研究聚焦当前语音助手处理复杂任务的主流方式——朗读书面指令——的局限性。我们以菜谱为例，观察12名参与者在家庭环境中使用尖端语音助手进行烹饪的过程，发现现有模式存在九大问题：包括模糊任务全景、信息过载、无法有效传达功能可见性等。语音播报的指令尤其不便，因其无法像文字指令那样快速浏览。特别是Alexa语音助手，既未能向用户呈现关键细节，也无法妥善回答问题。基于观察结果，我们提出语音助手"重写脚本"的八种策略：概括总结、路标指引、步骤拆分、细节补充、主动提议、顺序调整、内容重组和可视化呈现——通过将书面内容转化为适合语音对话的形式。最后我们展望如何利用现代自然语言处理技术的进步，使智能代理能有效引导用户完成复杂任务。

（翻译说明：采用学术论文摘要的简洁风格，保留专业术语如"功能可见性(affordances)"；将"rewrite the script"意译为"重写脚本"并保留引号强调；处理长句时拆分重组，如将"obscuring the bigger picture"等三个并列结构转换为中文常见的四字短语；技术术语如"natural language processing"统一译为"自然语言处理"；保持被动语态与主动语态的合理转换，符合中文表达习惯）
