原文摘要:
The AI community has been pursuing algorithms known as artificial general
intelligence (AGI) that apply to any kind of real-world problem. Recently, chat
systems powered by large language models (LLMs) emerge and rapidly become a
promising direction to achieve AGI in natural language processing (NLP), but
the path towards AGI in computer vision (CV) remains unclear. One may owe the
dilemma to the fact that visual signals are more complex than language signals,
yet we are interested in finding concrete reasons, as well as absorbing
experiences from GPT and LLMs to solve the problem. In this paper, we start
with a conceptual definition of AGI and briefly review how NLP solves a wide
range of tasks via a chat system. The analysis inspires us that unification is
the next important goal of CV. But, despite various efforts in this direction,
CV is still far from a system like GPT that naturally integrates all tasks. We
point out that the essential weakness of CV lies in lacking a paradigm to learn
from environments, yet NLP has accomplished the task in the text world. We then
imagine a pipeline that puts a CV algorithm (i.e., an agent) in world-scale,
interactable environments, pre-trains it to predict future frames with respect
to its action, and then fine-tunes it with instruction to accomplish various
tasks. We expect substantial research and engineering efforts to push the idea
forward and scale it up, for which we share our perspectives on future research
directions.

人工智能领域一直在追求一种适用于各类现实世界问题的算法，即通用人工智能（AGI）。近年来，基于大语言模型（LLM）的对话系统迅速崛起，成为自然语言处理（NLP）领域实现AGI的重要突破口，但计算机视觉（CV）领域的AGI发展路径仍不明朗。这一困境或许源于视觉信号比语言信号更为复杂，但我们更希望探寻深层原因，并借鉴GPT与LLM的成功经验来解决问题。本文首先给出AGI的概念定义，简要回顾NLP如何通过对话系统统一处理各类任务。这一分析启示我们：统一化是CV领域亟待实现的关键目标。尽管该方向已有诸多探索，CV领域仍未能构建出如GPT般自然整合所有任务的系统。我们指出，CV的根本弱点在于缺乏从环境中学习的范式，而NLP已在文本世界中实现了这一目标。由此我们构想了一个技术路径：将CV算法（即智能体）置于可交互的世界级环境中，通过预测其行为导致的未来帧进行预训练，再通过指令微调来完成多样化任务。要实现这一构想并推进规模化应用，仍需大量科研与工程投入，文末我们也对未来的研究方向提出了若干见解。
