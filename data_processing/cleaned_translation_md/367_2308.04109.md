# I-WAS: a Data Augmentation Method with GPT-2 for Simile Detection

原文摘要:
Simile detection is a valuable task for many natural language processing
(NLP)-based applications, particularly in the field of literature. However,
existing research on simile detection often relies on corpora that are limited
in size and do not adequately represent the full range of simile forms. To
address this issue, we propose a simile data augmentation method based on
\textbf{W}ord replacement And Sentence completion using the GPT-2 language
model. Our iterative process called I-WAS, is designed to improve the quality
of the augmented sentences. To better evaluate the performance of our method in
real-world applications, we have compiled a corpus containing a more diverse
set of simile forms for experimentation. Our experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed data augmentation method for simile
detection.

明喻检测对于许多基于自然语言处理（NLP）的应用（尤其在文学领域）具有重要价值。然而现有明喻检测研究往往依赖规模有限、未能充分涵盖各类明喻形式的语料库。为解决这一问题，我们提出基于GPT-2语言模型的\textbf{词语替换与句子补全}数据增强方法（WAS），并通过迭代优化流程I-WAS提升生成句子的质量。为更全面评估方法在实际应用中的表现，我们构建了包含更丰富明喻形式的实验语料库。实验结果验证了所提数据增强方法在明喻检测任务中的有效性。
