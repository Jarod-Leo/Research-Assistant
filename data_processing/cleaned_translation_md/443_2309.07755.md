原文摘要:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a
variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural language processing tasks,
such as content creation, report generation, etc. However, unregulated malign
application of these models can create undesirable consequences such as
generation of fake news, plagiarism, etc. As a result, accurate detection of
AI-generated language can be crucial in responsible usage of LLMs. In this
work, we explore 1) whether a certain body of text is AI generated or written
by human, and 2) attribution of a specific language model in generating a body
of text. Texts in both English and Spanish are considered. The datasets used in
this study are provided as part of the Automated Text Identification
(AuTexTification) shared task. For each of the research objectives stated
above, we propose an ensemble neural model that generates probabilities from
different pre-trained LLMs which are used as features to a Traditional Machine
Learning (TML) classifier following it. For the first task of distinguishing
between AI and human generated text, our model ranked in fifth and thirteenth
place (with macro $F1$ scores of 0.733 and 0.649) for English and Spanish
texts, respectively. For the second task on model attribution, our model ranked
in first place with macro $F1$ scores of 0.625 and 0.653 for English and
Spanish texts, respectively.

大型语言模型（LLMs）在各类人工智能（AI）与自然语言处理任务中展现出卓越性能，例如内容创作、报告生成等。然而若缺乏监管，这些模型的恶意应用可能导致虚假新闻生成、剽窃等不良后果。因此，准确检测AI生成文本对LLMs的负责任使用至关重要。本研究探索两大方向：1）判别特定文本由AI生成还是人类撰写；2）追溯文本生成的具体语言模型。研究涵盖英语与西班牙语文本，所用数据集来自"自动化文本识别（AuTexTification）"共享任务。针对上述目标，我们提出一种集成神经模型：通过不同预训练LLMs生成概率特征，再输入传统机器学习（TML）分类器进行判断。在AI与人类文本区分任务中，我们的模型在英语和西班牙语文本上分别以0.733和0.649的宏观F1分数位列第五和第十三名；在模型溯源任务中，该模型以英语0.625、西班牙语0.653的宏观F1分数双双夺得榜首。
