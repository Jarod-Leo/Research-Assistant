原文摘要:
The emergence of conversational natural language processing models presents a
significant challenge for Higher Education. In this work, we use the entirety
of a UK physics undergraduate (BSc with Honours) degree including all
examinations and coursework to test if ChatGPT (GPT-4) can pass a degree. We
adopt a "maximal cheating" approach wherein we permit ourselves to modify
questions for clarity, split questions up into smaller sub-components, expand
on answers given - especially for long form written responses, obtaining
references, and use of advanced coaching, plug-ins and custom instructions to
optimize outputs. In general, there are only certain parts of the degree in
question where GPT-4 fails. Explicitly these include compulsory laboratory
elements, and the final project which is assessed by a viva. If these were no
issue, then GPT-4 would pass with a grade of an upper second class overall. In
general, coding tasks are performed exceptionally well, along with simple
single-step solution problems. Multiple step problems and longer prose are
generally poorer along with interdisciplinary problems. We strongly suggest
that there is now a necessity to urgently re-think and revise assessment
practice in physics - and other disciplines - due to the existence of AI such
as GPT-4. We recommend close scrutiny of assessment tasks: only invigilated
in-person examinations, vivas, laboratory skills testing (or "performances" in
other disciplines), and presentations are not vulnerable to GPT-4, and urge
consideration of how AI can be embedded within the disciplinary context.

对话式自然语言处理模型的出现对高等教育构成了重大挑战。本研究采用英国物理学荣誉学士学位的全部课程内容（包括所有考试与作业）来测试ChatGPT（GPT-4）能否通过学位考核。我们采用"最大化作弊"策略：允许对题目进行清晰化修改、将问题拆分为更小子模块、扩展答案（特别是长篇书面回答）、获取参考文献，并使用高级提示技巧、插件和自定义指令来优化输出。总体而言，GPT-4仅在学位课程的特定环节存在明显缺陷，具体包括必修实验环节和需要通过答辩评估的毕业设计。若排除这些环节，GPT-4能以二等一级（Upper Second Class）的综合成绩通过考核。该模型在编码任务和简单单步求解问题上表现优异，但在多步骤问题、长篇论述及跨学科问题上表现较差。我们强烈建议：鉴于GPT-4等人工智能的存在，物理学及其他学科亟需重新思考并彻底改革评估体系。建议严格审查评估方式——目前仅现场监考笔试、答辩、实验技能测试（或其他学科的"实践演示"）和口头报告能有效规避GPT-4的影响，同时应深入探讨如何将AI有机融入学科教学体系。
