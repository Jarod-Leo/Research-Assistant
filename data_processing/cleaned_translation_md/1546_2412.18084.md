原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various natural language
processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. However,
due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for
biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still
limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this
work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction
Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use
textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs
to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations
to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing
open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle
molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property
prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks.
Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and
BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between
textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore,
PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation,
proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We
