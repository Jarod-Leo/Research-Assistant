原文摘要:
In recent years, as smart home systems have become more widespread, security
concerns within these environments have become a growing threat. Currently,
most smart home security solutions, such as anomaly detection and behavior
prediction models, are trained using fixed datasets that are precollected.
However, the process of dataset collection is time-consuming and lacks the
flexibility needed to adapt to the constantly evolving smart home environment.
Additionally, the collection of personal data raises significant privacy
concerns for users. Lately, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a
powerful tool for a wide range of tasks across diverse application domains,
thanks to their strong capabilities in natural language processing, reasoning,
and problem-solving. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based synthetic dataset
generation IoTGen framework to enhance the generalization of downstream smart
home intelligent models. By generating new synthetic datasets that reflect
changes in the environment, smart home intelligent models can be retrained to
overcome the limitations of fixed and outdated data, allowing them to better
align with the dynamic nature of real-world home environments. Specifically, we
first propose a Structure Pattern Perception Compression (SPPC) method tailored
for IoT behavior data, which preserves the most informative content in the data
while significantly reducing token consumption. Then, we propose a systematic
approach to create prompts and implement data generation to automatically
generate IoT synthetic data with normative and reasonable properties, assisting
task models in adaptive training to improve generalization and real-world
performance.

近年来，随着智能家居系统的普及，其环境中的安全问题已成为日益严重的威胁。当前大多数智能家居安全解决方案（如异常检测和行为预测模型）均采用预先收集的固定数据集进行训练。然而数据集收集过程耗时且缺乏灵活性，难以适应持续演变的智能家居环境。此外，个人数据的收集也引发了用户对隐私泄露的重大担忧。

近期，大语言模型（LLMs）凭借其在自然语言处理、推理和解决问题方面的强大能力，已成为跨领域任务处理的利器。本文提出基于LLM的合成数据集生成框架IoTGen，旨在提升下游智能家居模型的泛化能力。通过生成反映环境变化的新型合成数据集，可对智能模型进行再训练，从而突破固定过时数据的局限，使其更贴合真实家居环境的动态特性。

具体而言，我们首先提出面向物联网行为数据的结构模式感知压缩方法（SPPC），在保留数据核心信息量的同时显著降低token消耗。继而设计系统性提示词构建与数据生成方案，自动生成具有规范性和合理性的物联网合成数据，辅助任务模型通过自适应训练提升泛化能力与实际场景表现。
