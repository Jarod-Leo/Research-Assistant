原文摘要:
In the current era of Machine Learning, Transformers have become the de facto
approach across a variety of domains, such as computer vision and natural
language processing. Transformer-based solutions are the backbone of current
state-of-the-art methods for language generation, image and video
classification, segmentation, action and object recognition, among many others.
Interestingly enough, while these state-of-the-art methods produce impressive
results in their respective domains, the problem of understanding the
relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this
work, we propose a common ground between vision and language based on events in
space and time in an explainable and programmatic way, to connect
learning-based vision and language state of the art models and provide a
solution to the long standing problem of describing videos in natural language.
We validate that our algorithmic approach is able to generate coherent, rich
and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from a variety of
datasets, using both standard metrics (e.g. Bleu, ROUGE) and the modern
LLM-as-a-Jury approach.

在当前机器学习时代，Transformer模型已成为计算机视觉和自然语言处理等多个领域的事实标准。基于Transformer的解决方案构成了当前最先进方法的核心，广泛应用于语言生成、图像视频分类、分割、动作与物体识别等任务。值得注意的是，尽管这些尖端技术在各领域取得了令人瞩目的成果，但理解视觉与语言之间关联的根本问题仍未得到解决。本研究提出了一种基于时空事件的可解释、可编程的跨模态统一框架，通过连接基于学习的视觉与语言前沿模型，为"用自然语言描述视频内容"这一长期悬而未决的难题提供了解决方案。我们采用标准评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE）和新兴的"大语言模型陪审团"方法进行验证，证实所提出的算法能够为来自不同数据集的视频生成连贯、丰富且相关的文本描述。
