原文摘要:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional proficiency in natural
language processing but often fall short of generating creative and original
responses to open-ended questions. To enhance LLM creativity, our key insight
is to emulate the human process of inducing collective creativity through
engaging discussions with participants from diverse backgrounds and
perspectives. To this end, we propose LLM Discussion, a three-phase discussion
framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures
convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by
assigning distinct roles to LLMs to combat the homogeneity of LLMs. We evaluate
the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test,
Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both
LLM evaluation and human study. The results show that our proposed framework
outperforms single-LLM approaches and existing multi-LLM frameworks across
various creativity metrics. The code is available at
