原文摘要:
The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates great promise in the field of
medical discovery, diagnostics and patient management. However, the vast
complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines
machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately,
large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an
Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the
diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of
dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this
domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models
and sophisticated machine learning tools. This holistic approach achieves a
nuanced interpretation of dermatological conditions that simulates and
facilitates a dermatologist's workflow. We assess our proposed methodology
through a thorough cross-model validation technique embedded in an evaluation
pipeline that utilizes publicly available medical case studies of skin
conditions and relevant images. To quantitatively score the system performance,
advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools are employed
which focus on similarity comparison and natural language inference.
Additionally, we incorporate a human expert evaluation process based on a
structured checklist to further validate our results. We implemented the
proposed methodology in a system which achieved approximate (weighted) scores
of 0.87 for both contextual understanding and diagnostic accuracy,
demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing dermatological
analysis. The proposed methodology is expected to prove useful in the
development of next-generation tele-dermatology applications, enhancing remote
consultation capabilities and access to care, especially in underserved areas.

人工智能的崛起为医学发现、诊断和患者管理领域带来了巨大前景。然而，由于所有医学领域的高度复杂性，需要采用融合机器学习算法、分类器、分割算法以及近期大型语言模型的综合方法。本文描述、实现并评估了一套人工智能驱动的系统与方法论，旨在皮肤科领域内辅助皮肤病变及其他皮肤状况的诊断过程，力求全面覆盖该领域的诊断流程。该工作流整合了基于Transformer架构的大型语言模型、视觉模型以及精密的机器学习工具，通过这种整体性方法实现了对皮肤病症的精细化解读，从而模拟并优化皮肤科医生的工作流程。

我们采用嵌入评估管道的跨模型验证技术对提出方法进行全面评估，该管道利用了公开的皮肤病医学案例研究及相关图像。为量化系统性能，研究采用了聚焦于相似性比较和自然语言推理的先进机器学习与自然语言处理工具。此外，我们还引入了基于结构化清单的人类专家评估流程以进一步验证结果。实施该方法的系统在上下文理解和诊断准确性两项指标上均获得约0.87（加权）评分，证明了我们提出的方法在增强皮肤科分析方面的有效性。该预期将有助于开发新一代远程皮肤科应用，提升远程会诊能力与医疗可及性，特别是在医疗服务不足地区。
