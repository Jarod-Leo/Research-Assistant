原文摘要:
String processing, which mainly involves the analysis and manipulation of
strings, is a fundamental component of modern computing. Despite the
significant advancements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, their capability in string processing remains
underexplored and underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' string processing capability. In particular, we
first propose StringLLM, a method to construct datasets for benchmarking string
processing capability of LLMs. We use StringLLM to build a series of datasets,
referred to as StringBench. It encompasses a wide range of string processing
tasks, allowing us to systematically evaluate LLMs' performance in this area.
Our evaluations indicate that LLMs struggle with accurately processing strings
compared to humans. To uncover the underlying reasons for this limitation, we
conduct an in-depth analysis and subsequently propose an effective approach
that significantly enhances LLMs' string processing capability via fine-tuning.
This work provides a foundation for future research to understand LLMs' string
processing capability. Our code and data are available at
