原文摘要:
Software defined networking (SDN) represents a transformative shift in
network architecture by decoupling the control plane from the data plane,
enabling centralized and flexible management of network resources. However,
this architectural shift introduces significant security challenges, as SDN's
centralized control becomes an attractive target for various types of attacks.
While current research has yielded valuable insights into attack detection in
SDN, critical gaps remain. Addressing challenges in feature selection,
broadening the scope beyond DDoS attacks, strengthening attack decisions based
on multi flow analysis, and building models capable of detecting unseen attacks
that they have not been explicitly trained on are essential steps toward
advancing security in SDN. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that
leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the pre trained BERT base model
to enhance attack detection in SDN. Our approach transforms network flow data
into a format interpretable by language models, allowing BERT to capture
intricate patterns and relationships within network traffic. By using Random
Forest for feature selection, we optimize model performance and reduce
computational overhead, ensuring accurate detection. Attack decisions are made
based on several flows, providing stronger and more reliable detection of
malicious traffic. Furthermore, our approach is specifically designed to detect
previously unseen attacks, offering a solution for identifying threats that the
model was not explicitly trained on. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we
conducted experiments in two scenarios: one focused on detecting known attacks,
achieving 99.96% accuracy, and another on detecting unseen attacks, where our
model achieved 99.96% accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of our approach in
detecting evolving threats to improve the security of SDN networks.

软件定义网络（SDN）通过解耦控制平面与数据平面，实现了网络资源的集中化灵活管理，标志着网络架构的革命性转变。然而这种架构变革也带来了严峻的安全挑战——集中式控制特性使SDN成为各类攻击的诱人目标。尽管现有研究在SDN攻击检测方面已取得重要成果，但仍存在若干关键缺陷：需优化特征选择方法、突破当前以DDoS为主的检测局限、强化基于多流分析的攻击判定机制，以及构建能够识别训练数据之外新型攻击的检测模型。这些正是提升SDN安全防护水平的核心方向。

本文提出一种创新方案，通过自然语言处理（NLP）技术结合预训练的BERT基础模型来增强SDN攻击检测能力。我们将网络流数据转化为语言模型可解析的格式，使BERT能够捕捉流量中的复杂模式与关联特征。采用随机森林算法进行特征选择，在优化模型性能的同时降低计算开销，确保检测准确性。基于多流联合分析的攻击判定机制，显著提升了恶意流量检测的可靠性与鲁棒性。特别值得注意的是，本方案专门设计了识别未知攻击的能力，为检测训练集未涵盖的新型威胁提供了解决方案。

为全面验证方案有效性，我们在两种场景下开展实验：已知攻击检测场景取得99.96%准确率；未知攻击检测场景同样达到99.96%准确率。实验结果充分证明了本方案在应对持续演变的网络威胁方面的卓越性能，为提升SDN网络安全防护提供了有效途径。
