原文摘要:
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more
researchers apply LLMs for Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods, bringing
vitality to this classical Natural Language Processing task. However, existing
datasets are designed for traditional machine learning methods, inadequate for
LLM-based methods in terms of corpus selection, entity categorization, and
design logic. This limitation leads to less effective evaluation and model
fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose DynamicNER, the first NER
dataset specifically designed for LLMs and with dynamic categorization,
transcending the limitations of fixed categorization in existing datasets. It
is also multi-lingual and multi-granular, covering 8 languages and 155 entity
types, with corpus spanning multiple specialized domains. Furthermore, in
response to the limitations demonstrated by existing LLM-based methods during
DynamicNER testing, we develop CascadeNER, a novel NER method based on a
two-stage strategy and lightweight LLMs, addressing the problems in current
methods. Experiments show that DynamicNER is an effective benchmark for
LLM-based NER methods, and CascadeNER outperforms existing methods with fewer
computational resources. Our work is opened at
