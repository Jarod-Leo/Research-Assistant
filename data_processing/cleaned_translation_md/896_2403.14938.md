原文摘要:
With the emergence of numerous Large Language Models (LLM), the usage of such
models in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications is increasing
extensively. Counterspeech generation is one such key task where efforts are
made to develop generative models by fine-tuning LLMs with hatespeech -
counterspeech pairs, but none of these attempts explores the intrinsic
properties of large language models in zero-shot settings. In this work, we
present a comprehensive analysis of the performances of four LLMs namely GPT-2,
DialoGPT, ChatGPT and FlanT5 in zero-shot settings for counterspeech
generation, which is the first of its kind. For GPT-2 and DialoGPT, we further
investigate the deviation in performance with respect to the sizes (small,
medium, large) of the models. On the other hand, we propose three different
prompting strategies for generating different types of counterspeech and
analyse the impact of such strategies on the performance of the models. Our
analysis shows that there is an improvement in generation quality for two
datasets (17%), however the toxicity increase (25%) with increase in model
size. Considering type of model, GPT-2 and FlanT5 models are significantly
better in terms of counterspeech quality but also have high toxicity as
compared to DialoGPT. ChatGPT are much better at generating counter speech than
other models across all metrics. In terms of prompting, we find that our
proposed strategies help in improving counter speech generation across all the
models.

随着大型语言模型（LLM）的涌现，此类模型在自然语言处理（NLP）各类应用中的使用正迅速增长。反制言论生成作为关键任务之一，当前研究主要通过微调LLM模型（使用仇恨言论-反制言论配对数据）来开发生成模型，但这些尝试均未探索大型语言模型在零样本设置下的内在特性。本研究首次对GPT-2、DialoGPT、ChatGPT和FlanT5四种LLM在零样本设置下的反制言论生成性能展开全面分析。针对GPT-2和DialoGPT，我们进一步探究了不同模型规模（小/中/大）对性能的影响差异。同时，我们提出三种不同的提示策略以生成不同类型的反制言论，并分析这些策略对模型性能的影响。实验表明：随着模型规模增大，两个数据集的生成质量提升17%，但毒性水平也增加了25%。就模型类型而言，GPT-2和FlanT5在反制言论质量上显著更优，但毒性水平也高于DialoGPT；ChatGPT在所有评估指标上都明显优于其他模型。在提示策略方面，我们提出的方法有效提升了所有模型的反制言论生成效果。
