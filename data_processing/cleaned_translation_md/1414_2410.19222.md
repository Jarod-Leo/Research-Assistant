原文摘要:
In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains beyond traditional text generation.
In this work, we introduce PeptideGPT, a protein language model tailored to
generate protein sequences with distinct properties: hemolytic activity,
solubility, and non-fouling characteristics. To facilitate a rigorous
evaluation of these generated sequences, we established a comprehensive
evaluation pipeline consisting of ideas from bioinformatics to retain valid
proteins with ordered structures. First, we rank the generated sequences based
on their perplexity scores, then we filter out those lying outside the
permissible convex hull of proteins. Finally, we predict the structure using
ESMFold and select the proteins with pLDDT values greater than 70 to ensure
ordered structure. The properties of generated sequences are evaluated using
task-specific classifiers - PeptideBERT and HAPPENN. We achieved an accuracy of
76.26% in hemolytic, 72.46% in non-hemolytic, 78.84% in non-fouling, and 68.06%
in solubility protein generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PeptideGPT in de novo protein design and underscore the
potential of leveraging NLP-based approaches for paving the way for future
innovations and breakthroughs in synthetic biology and bioinformatics. Codes,
