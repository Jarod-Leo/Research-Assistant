原文摘要:
The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to
significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. However,
the evaluation of LLMs' legal knowledge, particularly in non-English languages
such as Arabic, remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce
ArabLegalEval, a multitask benchmark dataset for assessing the Arabic legal
knowledge of LLMs. Inspired by the MMLU and LegalBench datasets, ArabLegalEval
consists of multiple tasks sourced from Saudi legal documents and synthesized
questions. In this work, we aim to analyze the capabilities required to solve
legal problems in Arabic and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art
LLMs. We explore the impact of in-context learning and investigate various
evaluation methods. Additionally, we explore workflows for generating questions
with automatic validation to enhance the dataset's quality. We benchmark
multilingual and Arabic-centric LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Jais, respectively. We
also share our methodology for creating the dataset and validation, which can
be generalized to other domains. We hope to accelerate AI research in the
Arabic Legal domain by releasing the ArabLegalEval dataset and code:
