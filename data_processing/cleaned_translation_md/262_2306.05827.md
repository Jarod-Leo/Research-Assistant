原文摘要:
With the ever-increasing utilization of natural language processing (NLP), we
started to witness over the past few years a significant transformation in our
interaction with legal texts. This technology has advanced the analysis and
enhanced the understanding of complex legal terminology and contexts. The
development of recent large language models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT, has
also introduced a revolutionary contribution to the way that legal texts can be
processed and comprehended. In this paper, we present our work on a
cooperative-legal question-answering LLM-based chatbot, where we developed a
set of legal questions about Palestinian cooperatives, associated with their
regulations and compared the auto-generated answers by the chatbot to their
correspondences that are designed by a legal expert. To evaluate the proposed
chatbot, we have used 50 queries generated by the legal expert and compared the
answers produced by the chart to their relevance judgments. Finding
demonstrated that an overall accuracy rate of 82% has been achieved when
answering the queries, while exhibiting an F1 score equivalent to 79%.

随着自然语言处理（NLP）技术的日益广泛应用，过去几年我们见证了与法律文本交互方式的重大变革。该技术不仅推动了复杂法律术语和语境的分析进程，更显著提升了其理解深度。近期大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展，特别是ChatGPT的出现，为法律文本的处理与解读带来了革命性突破。本文重点介绍基于LLM的合作型法律问答聊天机器人的研发工作：我们构建了一套关于巴勒斯坦合作社的法律问题集（关联其相关法规），并将聊天机器人自动生成的答案与法律专家设计的标准答案进行比对验证。为评估该聊天机器人的性能，我们采用法律专家生成的50组查询问题，通过对比系统输出答案与人工相关性判定结果发现：在回答查询时总体准确率达到82%，F1分数达79%。
