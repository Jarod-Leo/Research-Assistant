标题: A Machine-Learning Compositional Study of Exoplanetary Material Accreted Onto Five Helium-Atmosphere White Dwarfs with $\texttt{cecilia}$
摘要: We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline
$\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric
composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without
well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint
and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and
$\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range
from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at
least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a
predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques
($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy
elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously
exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all
systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely
consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also
find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for
SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of
oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical
surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community,
$\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs,
therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar
compositions.

标题: Anymate: A Dataset and Baselines for Learning 3D Object Rigging
摘要: Rigging and skinning are essential steps to create realistic 3D animations,
often requiring significant expertise and manual effort. Traditional attempts
at automating these processes rely heavily on geometric heuristics and often
struggle with objects of complex geometry. Recent data-driven approaches show
potential for better generality, but are often constrained by limited training
data. We present the Anymate Dataset, a large-scale dataset of 230K 3D assets
paired with expert-crafted rigging and skinning information -- 70 times larger
than existing datasets. Using this dataset, we propose a learning-based
auto-rigging framework with three sequential modules for joint, connectivity,
and skinning weight prediction. We systematically design and experiment with
various architectures as baselines for each module and conduct comprehensive
evaluations on our dataset to compare their performance. Our models
significantly outperform existing methods, providing a foundation for comparing
future methods in automated rigging and skinning. Code and dataset can be found

标题: Anomalous spin dynamics after dual optical excitation
摘要: Ultrashort optical pulses are a cornerstone for manipulating electronic and
magnetic states in materials on a femtosecond timescale. Conventional models
assume that optical excitation primarily modifies the occupation of the
electron energy levels without long-lasting altering of the coupling of
individual electrons in certain processes. Here, we demonstrate that optical
excitation with two femtosecond pulses that come from different directions
fundamentally transforms the electron dynamics in copper, affecting the
efficiency of angular momentum transfer between electrons and the lattice.
Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we reveal a ~2.5.
increase in spin imbalance decay time following inverse Faraday effect
excitation under dual-pump conditions compared to single-pulse excitation. This
observation challenges the prevailing paradigm of ultrafast light-matter
interactions, showing that dual optical excitation can transiently modify
electron dynamics beyond simple changes in the energy levels occupancy. Our
findings open new avenues for controlling quantum states through a dual pump
approach, with implications for ultrafast spintronics and the design of novel
light-driven states.

标题: Towards a Unified Representation Evaluation Framework Beyond Downstream Tasks
摘要: Downstream probing has been the dominant method for evaluating model
representations, an important process given the increasing prominence of
self-supervised learning and foundation models. However, downstream probing
primarily assesses the availability of task-relevant information in the model's
latent space, overlooking attributes such as equivariance, invariance, and
disentanglement, which contribute to the interpretability, adaptability, and
utility of representations in real-world applications. While some attempts have
been made to measure these qualities in representations, no unified evaluation
framework with modular, generalizable, and interpretable metrics exists.
  In this paper, we argue for the importance of representation evaluation
beyond downstream probing. We introduce a standardized protocol to quantify
informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement of factors of
variation in model representations. We use it to evaluate representations from
a variety of models in the image and speech domains using different
architectures and pretraining approaches on identified controllable factors of
variation. We find that representations from models with similar downstream
performance can behave substantially differently with regard to these
attributes. This hints that the respective mechanisms underlying their
downstream performance are functionally different, prompting new research
directions to understand and improve representations.

标题: Testing the Hypothesis that the Quasar J0950+5128 Harbors a Supermassive Black Hole Binary
摘要: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950+5128 spanning 22 years show
that its broad H$\beta$ emission line displays monotonic radial velocity
variations consistent with those expected from a supermassive binary. At the
same time, the profile of the broad H$\beta$ line is changing, necessitating
careful measurements. We present robust measurements of the broad H$\beta$
velocity shifts. We fit the spectra with a multi-component parametric model to
isolate the broad H$\beta$ by removing the stellar and non-stellar continua,
the Fe ii line blends, and various narrow and broad emission lines in its
vicinity. We measure the H$\beta$ velocity shifts via cross-correlation, both
before and after decomposing the spectra, and we demonstrate that they can be
reliably measured in spite of variations in the line profiles. We incorporate
radial velocity "jitter" into the radial velocity curve to emulate typical
quasar variability, and fit the curve with a Keplerian orbit model. The fit
yields a period of 33 years and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on
the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}$ pc and $10^7\ M_\odot$,
respectively. Thus, this quasar is a compelling supermassive binary candidate.
Continued monitoring is essential to further evaluate its credentials.

标题: Adapting a Segmentation Foundation Model for Medical Image Classification
摘要: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have shown strong performance in various vision tasks, particularly
image segmentation, due to their impressive zero-shot segmentation
capabilities. However, effectively adapting such models for medical image
classification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a
new framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize
the SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based
features that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image,
while freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next,
we propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to
compute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The
features extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to
compute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning
classification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or
meaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance.
Experimental results on three public medical image classification datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach.

标题: A dissipative logarithmic type evolution of second order in time
摘要: In this paper, we introduce a logarithmic-type second-order model with a
non-local logarithmic damping mechanism in $R^N$. We present a motivation with
a spectral approach to consider the equation, we consider the Cauchy problem
associated with the model. More precisely, we study the asymptotic behavior of
solutions as $t$ goes to infinity in $L^2$-sense; namely, we prove results on
the asymptotic profile and optimal decay of solutions as time goes to infinity
in $L^2$-sense.

标题: Alternating Methods for Large-Scale AC Optimal Power Flow with Unit Commitment
摘要: Security-constrained unit commitment with alternating current optimal power
flow (SCUC-ACOPF) is a central problem in power grid operations that optimizes
commitment and dispatch of generators under a physically accurate power
transmission model while encouraging robustness against component failures.
SCUC-ACOPF requires solving large-scale problems that involve multiple time
periods and networks with thousands of buses within strict time limits. In this
work, we study a detailed SCUC-ACOPF model with a rich set of features of
modern power grids, including price-sensitive load, reserve products,
transformer controls, and energy-limited devices. We propose a decomposition
scheme and a penalty alternating direction method to find high-quality
solutions to this model. Our methodology leverages spatial and temporal
decomposition, separating the problem into a set of mixed-integer linear
programs for each bus and a set of continuous nonlinear programs for each time
period. To improve the performance of the algorithm, we introduce a variety of
heuristics, including restrictions of temporal linking constraints, a
second-order cone relaxation, and a contingency screening algorithm. We
quantify the quality of feasible solutions through a dual bound from a convex
second-order cone program. To evaluate our algorithm, we use large-scale test
cases from Challenge 3 of the U.S. Department of Energy's Grid Optimization
Competition that resemble real power grid data under a variety of operating
conditions and decision horizons. The experiments yield feasible solutions with
an average optimality gap of 1.33%, demonstrating that this approach generates
near-optimal solutions within stringent time limits.

标题: Topo-VM-UNetV2: Encoding Topology into Vision Mamba UNet for Polyp Segmentation
摘要: Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer-based architectures are
two dominant deep learning models for polyp segmentation. However, CNNs have
limited capability for modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformers
incur quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models such as
Mamba have been recognized as a promising approach for polyp segmentation
because they not only model long-range interactions effectively but also
maintain linear computational complexity. However, Mamba-based architectures
still struggle to capture topological features (e.g., connected components,
loops, voids), leading to inaccurate boundary delineation and polyp
segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach called
Topo-VM-UNetV2, which encodes topological features into the Mamba-based
state-of-the-art polyp segmentation model, VM-UNetV2. Our method consists of
two stages: Stage 1: VM-UNetV2 is used to generate probability maps (PMs) for
the training and test images, which are then used to compute topology attention
maps. Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams of the PMs, then we
generate persistence score maps by assigning persistence values (i.e., the
difference between death and birth times) of each topological feature to its
birth location, finally we transform persistence scores into attention weights
using the sigmoid function. Stage 2: These topology attention maps are
integrated into the semantics and detail infusion (SDI) module of VM-UNetV2 to
form a topology-guided semantics and detail infusion (Topo-SDI) module for
enhancing the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on five public polyp
segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The
code will be made publicly available.

for the heterogeneous one-dimensional Ising model, which recovers the correct
rate of exponential decay of covariances in the case of random i.i.d.
interaction and external field.

标题: Guerra interpolation for inverse freezing
摘要: In these short notes, we adapt and systematically apply Guerra's
interpolation techniques on a class of disordered mean-field spin glasses
equipped with crystal fields and multi-value spin variables. These models
undergo the phenomenon of inverse melting or inverse freezing. In particular,
we focus on the Ghatak-Sherrington model, its extension provided by Katayama
and Horiguchi, and the disordered Blume-Emery-Griffiths-Capel model in the
mean-field limit, deepened by Crisanti and Leuzzi and by Schupper and Shnerb.
Once shown how all these models can be retrieved as particular limits of a
unique broader Hamiltonian, we study their free energies. We provide explicit
expressions of their annealed and quenched expectations, inspecting the cases
of replica symmetry and (first-step) broken replica symmetry. We recover
several results previously obtained via heuristic approaches (mainly the
replica trick) to prove full agreement with the existing literature. As a
sideline, we also inspect the onset of replica symmetry breaking by providing
analytically the expression of the de Almeida-Thouless instability line for a
replica symmetric description: in this general setting, the latter is new also
from a physical viewpoint.

标题: Robust Multi-Agent Decision-Making in Finite-Population Games
摘要: We study the robustness of an agent decision-making model in
finite-population games, with a particular focus on the Kullback-Leibler
Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model. Specifically, we examine how
the model's parameters influence the effects of various sources of noise and
modeling inaccuracies -- factors commonly encountered in engineering
applications of population games -- on agents' decision-making. Our analysis
provides insights into how these parameters can be effectively tuned to
mitigate such effects. Theoretical results are supported by numerical examples
and simulation studies that validate the analysis and illustrate practical
strategies for parameter selection.

标题: On Optimal Batch Size in Coded Computing
摘要: We consider computing systems that partition jobs into tasks, add redundancy
through coding, and assign the encoded tasks to different computing nodes for
parallel execution. The expected execution time depends on the level of
redundancy. The computing nodes execute large jobs in batches of tasks. We show
that the expected execution time depends on the batch size as well. The optimal
batch size that minimizes the execution time depends on the level of redundancy
under a fixed number of parallel servers and other system parameters.
Furthermore, we show how to (jointly) optimize the redundancy level and batch
size to reduce the expected job completion time for two service-time
distributions. The simulation presented helps us appreciate the claims.

标题: The "Dark-Matter Dominated" Galaxy Segue 1 Modeled with a Black Hole and no Dark Halo
摘要: The dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Segue 1, is thought to have one of the largest
ratios of dark matter to stellar mass. Using orbit-based dynamical models, we
model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit
model requires a black hole mass of $4 \pm 1.5 \times 10^5\ M_\odot$. The value
of the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The
mass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical
modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars.
Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a
dark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the
zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly
radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that
is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue
that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better
description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark
halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a
significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we
measure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \pm 2.4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is
likely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the
remnant nucleus of a more massive system. Alternatively, given the high black
hole mass relative to the stellar mass, Segue 1 is analogous to Little Red Dots
seen in the early Universe.

标题: An Effective Theory for Higgs Inflation
摘要: The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the
production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs
inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in
which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is
modified by quantum corrections, described by a series of higher-dimension
operators. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models
in which the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated by the Higgs field
is consistent with CMB observations and can lead to the formation of primordial
black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety
of dark matter.

标题: Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity
摘要: The chiral magnetic effect (CME), a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum
chiral anomaly, induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating
mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the
finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes,
we demonstrate that the CME remains effective and plays a significant role in
the magnetic field evolution of magnetars. The magnetic helicity acts as a
persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the
redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an
external energy source. Focusing on the neutron star crust, we show that this
mechanism reshapes the magnetic field configuration inherited at birth and,
within a hundred years, amplifies both toroidal and poloidal large-scale
dipolar components (relevant for spin-down) up to $10^{14}$ G at the expense of
small-scale structures. Our results offer a microphysical mechanism,
alternative to traditional hydrodynamic dynamo models, establishing a new
framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics.

标题: ProME: An Integrated Computational Platform for Material Properties at Extremes and Its Application in Multicomponent Alloy Design
摘要: We have built an integrated computational platform for material properties at
extreme conditions, ProME (Professional Materials at Extremes) v1.0, which
enables integrated calculations for multicomponent alloys, covering high
temperatures up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, high pressures up to millions
of atmospheres, and high strain rates up to millions per second. A series of
software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including
ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE
(Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$
(Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase
thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity
Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for
electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software)
for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates,
and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable
compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the
quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine
nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature
strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly
reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing
both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in
materials research and development.

标题: Ohana trees and Taylor expansion for the $λ$I-calculus. No variable gets left behind or forgotten!
摘要: Although the $\lambda$I-calculus is a natural fragment of the
$\lambda$-calculus, obtained by forbidding the erasure, its equational theories
did not receive much attention. The reason is that all proper denotational
models studied in the literature equate all non-normalizable $\lambda$I-terms,
whence the associated theory is not very informative. The goal of this paper is
to introduce a previously unknown theory of the $\lambda$I-calculus, induced by
a notion of evaluation trees that we call "Ohana trees". The Ohana tree of a
$\lambda$I-term is an annotated version of its B\"ohm tree, remembering all
free variables that are hidden within its meaningless subtrees, or pushed into
infinity along its infinite branches.
  We develop the associated theories of program approximation: the first
approach -- more classic -- is based on finite trees and continuity, the second
adapts Ehrhard and Regnier's Taylor expansion. We then prove a Commutation
Theorem stating that the normal form of the Taylor expansion of a
$\lambda$I-term coincides with the Taylor expansion of its Ohana tree. As a
corollary, we obtain that the equality induced by Ohana trees is compatible
with abstraction and application. We conclude by discussing the cases of
L\'evy-Longo and Berarducci trees, and generalizations to the full
$\lambda$-calculus.

标题: Neuro-Symbolic Concepts
摘要: This article presents a concept-centric paradigm for building agents that can
learn continually and reason flexibly. The concept-centric agent utilizes a
vocabulary of neuro-symbolic concepts. These concepts, such as object,
relation, and action concepts, are grounded on sensory inputs and actuation
outputs. They are also compositional, allowing for the creation of novel
concepts through their structural combination. To facilitate learning and
reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of
symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such
neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to
solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos,
3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks. This concept-centric framework
offers several advantages, including data efficiency, compositional
generalization, continual learning, and zero-shot transfer.

标题: Beyond the Mean: Limit Theory and Tests for Infinite-Mean Autoregressive Conditional Durations
摘要: Integrated autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models serve as natural
counterparts to the well-known integrated GARCH models used for financial
returns. However, despite their resemblance, asymptotic theory for ACD is
challenging and also not complete, in particular for integrated ACD. Central
challenges arise from the facts that (i) integrated ACD processes imply
durations with infinite expectation, and (ii) even in the non-integrated case,
conventional asymptotic approaches break down due to the randomness in the
number of durations within a fixed observation period. Addressing these
challenges, we provide here unified asymptotic theory for the (quasi-) maximum
likelihood estimator for ACD models; a unified theory which includes integrated
ACD models. Based on the new results, we also provide a novel framework for
hypothesis testing in duration models, enabling inference on a key empirical
question: whether durations possess a finite or infinite expectation. We apply
our results to high-frequency cryptocurrency ETF trading data. Motivated by
parameter estimates near the integrated ACD boundary, we assess whether
durations between trades in these markets have finite expectation, an
assumption often made implicitly in the literature on point process models. Our
empirical findings indicate infinite-mean durations for all the five
cryptocurrencies examined, with the integrated ACD hypothesis rejected --
against alternatives with tail index less than one -- for four out of the five
cryptocurrencies considered.

标题: Efficient time-domain scattering synthesis via frequency-domain singularity subtraction
摘要: Fourier-transform-based methods enable accurate, dispersion-free
  simulations of time-domain scattering problems by evaluating
  solutions to the Helmholtz equation at a discrete set of
  frequencies, sufficient to approximate the inverse Fourier
  transform. However, in the case of scattering by trapping obstacles,
  the Helmholtz solution exhibits nearly-real complex
  resonances -- which significantly slows the convergence of numerical
  inverse transform. To address this difficulty this paper introduces
  a frequency-domain singularity subtraction technique that
  regularizes the integrand of the inverse transform and efficiently
  computes the singularity contribution via a combination of a
  straightforward and inexpensive numerical technique together with a
  large-time asymptotic expansion. Crucially, all relevant
  complex resonances and their residues are determined via rational
  approximation of integral equation solutions at real
  frequencies. An adaptive algorithm is employed to ensure that all
  relevant complex resonances are properly identified.

标题: Preferential Attachment Trees with Vertex Death: Persistence of the Maximum Degree
摘要: We consider an evolving random discrete tree model called Preferential
Attachment with Vertex Death, as introduced by Deijfen. Initialised with an
alive root labelled $1$, at each step $n\geq1$ either a new vertex with label
$n+1$ is introduced that attaches to an existing alive vertex selected
preferentially according to a function $b$, or an alive vertex is selected
preferentially according to a function $d$ and killed. In this article we
introduce a generalised concept of persistence for evolving random graph
models. Let $O_n$ be the smallest label among all alive vertices (the oldest
alive vertex), and let $I_n^m$ be the label of the alive vertex with the
$m^{\mathrm{th}}$ largest degree. We say a persistent $m$-hub exists if $I_n^m$
converges almost surely, we say that persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ is
tight, and that lack of persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ tends to infinity.
We identify two regimes called the infinite lifetime and finite lifetime
regimes. In the infinite lifetime regime, vertices are never killed with
positive probability. Here, we provide conditions under which we prove the
(non-)existence of persistent $m$-hubs for any $m\in\mathbb N$. This expands
and generalises recent work of Iyer, which covers the case $d\equiv 0$ and
$m=1$. In the finite lifetime regime, vertices are killed after a finite number
of steps almost surely. Here we provide conditions under which we prove the
occurrence of persistence, which complements recent work of Heydenreich and the
author, where lack of persistence is studied for preferential attachment with
vertex death.

标题: Query-driven Document-level Scientific Evidence Extraction from Biomedical Studies
摘要: Extracting scientific evidence from biomedical studies for clinical research
questions (e.g., Does stem cell transplantation improve quality of life in
patients with medically refractory Crohn's disease compared to placebo?) is a
crucial step in synthesising biomedical evidence. In this paper, we focus on
the task of document-level scientific evidence extraction for clinical
questions with conflicting evidence. To support this task, we create a dataset
called CochraneForest, leveraging forest plots from Cochrane systematic
reviews. It comprises 202 annotated forest plots, associated clinical research
questions, full texts of studies, and study-specific conclusions. Building on
CochraneForest, we propose URCA (Uniform Retrieval Clustered Augmentation), a
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to tackle the unique
challenges of evidence extraction. Our experiments show that URCA outperforms
the best existing methods by up to 10.3% in F1 score on this task. However, the
results also underscore the complexity of CochraneForest, establishing it as a
challenging testbed for advancing automated evidence synthesis systems.

标题: From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling
摘要: Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks
like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring,
and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including
tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation
learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability,
produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on
rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large
language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements,
which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain
as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs
semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates
both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative
tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with
minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while
reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates
interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data
into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for
downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X)
dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation.
Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in
creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.

标题: Long time behaviour of Mean Field Games with fractional diffusion
摘要: In this paper we study the long time behaviour of mean field games systems
with fractional diffusion, modeling the case that the individual dynamics of
the players is driven by independent jump processes and controlled through the
drift term, while being confined by an external field in order to guarantee
ergodicity. In the case of globally Lipschitz, locally uniformly convex
Hamiltonian, and weakly coupled costs satisfying the Lasry-Lions monotonicity
condition, we prove that there is a unique solution $(u_T,m_T)$ to the mean
field game problem in $(0,T)$ and we show that, if $T$ is sufficiently large,
$(u_T,m_T)$ satisfies the so-called turnpike property, namely it is
exponentially close to the (unique) stationary ergodic state for any
proportionally long intermediate time.

标题: Active Perception for Tactile Sensing: A Task-Agnostic Attention-Based Approach
摘要: Humans make extensive use of haptic exploration to map and identify the
properties of the objects that we touch. In robotics, active tactile perception
has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks
such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This
work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that
leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to
address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP
integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified
optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and
decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in
principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across
diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving
haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST
haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These
findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable
framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.

标题: Noncommutative fields in Reissner-Nordström black hole background
摘要: In this short paper we discuss dynamics of noncommutative (NC) matter fields
in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole background. After reviewing the
propagation of charged NC scalar and spinor fields, we derive the equation
governing the propagation of NC electromagnetic (EM) perturbation in the RN
background. The propagation of NC scalar and spinor perturbation have a dual
description in terms of the propagation of commutative fields in the
effective/dual metric. Finally, we turn to the gravitational perturbations. We
present equations of motion for the NC gravitational field obtained in two
different models: $SO(2,3)_\star$ NC gravity and braided NC gravity. Typically
for NC gravity models, the first nontrivial corrections are quadratic in the NC
parameter. The obtained NC gravity equations are the starting point to discuss
the propagation of NC gravitational perturbations and the validity of the dual
description in terms of the effective metric.

标题: A Large Language Model-Enhanced Q-learning for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows
摘要: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics
distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the
constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant
challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This
paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW
with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive
two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration
phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability,
we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical
constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the
experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the
architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a
7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer
training steps required for convergence.

标题: MonetGPT: Solving Puzzles Enhances MLLMs' Image Retouching Skills
摘要: Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs.
Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible
to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in
unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional
procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,
Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.
Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual
procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In
this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to
critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them
with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate
that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing
operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.
Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit
sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we
synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits
and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize
reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by
construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and
resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a
variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and
identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural
alternatives. Code, data, models, and supplementary results can be found via
our project website at https://monetgpt.github.io.

标题: Turbo-ICL: In-Context Learning-Based Turbo Equalization
摘要: This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired
by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel
equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The
proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from
a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of
prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder
output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol
estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants,
based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and
evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear
assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization,
ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even
when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results
also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training
diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in
resource-constrained scenarios.

标题: Leakage-resilient Algebraic Manipulation Detection Codes with Optimal Parameters
摘要: Algebraic Manipulation Detection (AMD) codes is a cryptographic primitive
that was introduced by Cramer, Dodis, Fehr, Padro and Wichs. They are keyless
message authentication codes that protect messages against additive tampering
by the adversary assuming that the adversary cannot "see" the codeword. For
certain applications, it is unreasonable to assume that the adversary computes
the added offset without any knowledge of the codeword c. Recently, Ahmadi and
Safavi-Naini, and then Lin, Safavi-Naini, and Wang gave a construction of
leakage-resilient AMD codes where the adversary has some partial information
about the codeword before choosing added offset, and the scheme is secure even
conditioned on this partial information. In this paper we establish bounds on
the leakage rate r and the code rate k for leakage-resilient AMD codes. In
particular we prove that 2r + k < 1 and for the weak case (security is averaged
over a uniformly random message) r + k < 1. These bounds hold even if adversary
is polynomial-time bounded, as long as we allow leakage function to be
arbitrary. We present constructions of AMD codes that (asymptotically) fulfill
the above bounds for almost full range of parameters r and k. This shows that
the above bounds and constructions are in-fact optimal. In the last section we
show that if a leakage function is computationally bounded (we use the Ideal
Cipher Model) then it is possible to break these bounds.

标题: Revisiting the connection of baryon number, lepton number, and operator dimension
摘要: The effects of heavy new particles beyond the Standard Model can be
conveniently captured through higher-dimensional effective operators. As noted
long ago by Weinberg, the amount of baryon and lepton number an operator can
carry is intricately connected to its mass dimension. We derive an improved
inequality for this connection and compare it to explicit operator
constructions up to mass dimension 25. For the effective field theory of
Standard Model plus right-handed neutrinos, our relationship is even an
equality up to high mass dimension.

标题: Self-Supervised Federated GNSS Spoofing Detection with Opportunistic Data
摘要: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are vulnerable to spoofing
attacks, with adversarial signals manipulating the location or time information
of receivers, potentially causing severe disruptions. The task of discerning
the spoofing signals from benign ones is naturally relevant for machine
learning, thus recent interest in applying it for detection. While deep
learning-based methods are promising, they require extensive labeled datasets,
consume significant computational resources, and raise privacy concerns due to
the sensitive nature of position data. This is why this paper proposes a
self-supervised federated learning framework for GNSS spoofing detection. It
consists of a cloud server and local mobile platforms. Each mobile platform
employs a self-supervised anomaly detector using long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks. Labels for training are generated locally through a
spoofing-deviation prediction algorithm, ensuring privacy. Local models are
trained independently, and only their parameters are uploaded to the cloud
server, which aggregates them into a global model using FedAvg. The updated
global model is then distributed back to the mobile platforms and trained
iteratively. The evaluation shows that our self-supervised federated learning
framework outperforms position-based and deep learning-based methods in
detecting spoofing attacks while preserving data privacy.

标题: On the Depth of Monotone ReLU Neural Networks and ICNNs
摘要: We study two models of ReLU neural networks: monotone networks (ReLU$^+$) and
input convex neural networks (ICNN). Our focus is on expressivity, mostly in
terms of depth, and we prove the following lower bounds. For the maximum
function MAX$_n$ computing the maximum of $n$ real numbers, we show that
ReLU$^+$ networks cannot compute MAX$_n$, or even approximate it. We prove a
sharp $n$ lower bound on the ICNN depth complexity of MAX$_n$. We also prove
depth separations between ReLU networks and ICNNs; for every $k$, there is a
depth-2 ReLU network of size $O(k^2)$ that cannot be simulated by a depth-$k$
ICNN. The proofs are based on deep connections between neural networks and
polyhedral geometry, and also use isoperimetric properties of triangulations.

标题: Controlling the morphologies and dynamics in three-dimensional tissues
摘要: A number of factors, such as, cell-cell interactions and self-propulsion of
cells driven by cytoskeletal forces determine tissue morphologies and dynamics.
To explore the interplay between these factors in controlling the dynamics at
the tissue scale, we created a minimal three dimensional model in which
short-range repulsive elastic forces account for cell-cell interactions.
Self-propulsion is modeled as active uncorrelated random stochastic forces,
with strength $\mu$, that act on individual cells and is the only source of
cell motility. Strikingly, variations in polydispersity in cell sizes
($\Sigma$) and cell elasticity ($E$), results in the formation of a variety of
distinct ``phases", driven entirely by $\mu$. At low $E$, the tissue behaves
like a liquid, at all values of $\Sigma$, whereas at high $E$ and $\Sigma$, it
has the characteristics of a glass. The tissue crystallizes at low $\Sigma$
provided $E$ exceeds a critical value. Over a narrow range of $E$ and $\Sigma$,
that lies between the boundaries of the liquid and glass phase, the effective
viscosity increases like in a glass as the cell density increases and saturates
as the cells are compressed beyond a certain value, creating the viscosity
saturation (VS) phase. The VS phase does not form in systems at finite
temperature in which the dynamics satisfies the Fluctuation Dissipation
Theorem. In the glass phase, the tissue exhibits aging (relaxation times depend
on the waiting time) behavior at high $E$ values. Our findings provide a
framework for designing tissues with tunable material properties by controlling
the physical characteristics of cells.

标题: DiffLocks: Generating 3D Hair from a Single Image using Diffusion Models
摘要: We address the task of generating 3D hair geometry from a single image, which
is challenging due to the diversity of hairstyles and the lack of paired
image-to-3D hair data. Previous methods are primarily trained on synthetic data
and cope with the limited amount of such data by using low-dimensional
intermediate representations, such as guide strands and scalp-level embeddings,
that require post-processing to decode, upsample, and add realism. These
approaches fail to reconstruct detailed hair, struggle with curly hair, or are
limited to handling only a few hairstyles. To overcome these limitations, we
propose DiffLocks, a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a
wide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First, we address the
lack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair
dataset to date, containing 40K hairstyles. Second, we leverage the synthetic
hair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that
generates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a
pretrained image backbone, our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite
being trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp
texture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an
individual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without
post-processing techniques. Representing individual strands, instead of guide
strands, enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of
complex hairstyles. With this, DiffLocks can recover highly curled hair, like
afro hairstyles, from a single image for the first time. Data and code is
available at https://radualexandru.github.io/difflocks/

标题: Optimization of Quantum Error Correcting Code under Temporal Variation of Qubit Quality
摘要: Error rates in current noisy quantum hardware are not static; they vary over
time and across qubits. This temporal and spatial variation challenges the
effectiveness of fixed-distance quantum error correction (QEC) codes. In this
paper, we analyze 12 days of calibration data from IBM's 127-qubit device
(ibm_kyiv), showing the fluctuation of Pauli-X and CNOT gate error rates. We
demonstrate that fixed-distance QEC can either underperform or lead to
excessive overhead, depending on the selected qubit and the error rate of the
day. We then propose a simple adaptive QEC approach that selects an appropriate
code distance per qubit, based on daily error rates. Using logical error rate
modeling, we identify qubits that cannot be used and qubits that can be
recovered with minimal resources. Our method avoids unnecessary resource
overhead by excluding outlier qubits and tailoring code distances. Across 12
calibration days on ibm_kyiv, our adaptive strategy reduces physical qubit
overhead by over 50% per logical qubit while maintaining access to 85-100% of
usable qubits. To further validate the method, we repeat the experiment on two
additional 127-qubit devices, ibm_brisbane and ibm_sherbrooke, where the
overhead savings reach up to 71% while still preserving over 80% qubit
usability. This approach offers a practical and efficient path forward for
Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era QEC strategies.

标题: A sample of ionised Fe line-emitting X-ray sources in the inner Galactic disc
摘要: Previous studies suggest that the Galactic diffuse X-ray emission is composed
of unresolved point sources, primarily mCVs. However, nearby mCVs have a much
lower 6.7 keV line equivalent width ($\rm EW_{6.7}$) compared to the diffuse
X-ray emission. Therefore, the primary contributors to the unresolved X-ray
emission remain unclear. We detected a total of 859 sources in the 6.5-7 keV
band using XMM-Newton observations of the inner Galactic disc, of which 72
sources show significant iron line emission at 6.7 keV. The distribution of
spectral index $\Gamma$ for these 72 sources is bimodal, with peaks at
$\Gamma=0.5\pm0.4$ and $1.8\pm0.3$, suggesting two populations of sources. The
soft X-ray sources have significantly larger $\rm EW_{6.7}$ than the hard X-ray
sources. Furthermore, 18 of the 32 hard sources are associated with previously
known CVs. We identify CV candidates in our sample as those with spectral index
$\Gamma<1.25$. The line ratio, 2-10 keV luminosity, and previous detection of
spin period suggest that most of these hard sources are mCVs. The distribution
of the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ line for the combined sample of previously identified and
candidate CVs has a mean value of <$\rm EW_{6.7}$>$=415\pm39$ eV. Furthermore,
we computed the stacked spectra of all sources detected in the 6.5-7 keV band
for different flux groups, and we find evidence in the stacked spectra of hard
sources that the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ increases with decreasing flux. The soft X-ray
sources have <$\rm EW_{6.7}$>$=1.1\pm0.1$ keV. We identified 13 of the 30 soft
sources associated with active stars, young stellar objects, and active
binaries of RS CVn type. The <$\rm EW_{6.7}$> of our CV candidate sample is
more than twice as large as the typical $\rm EW_{6.7}$ found in mCVs within 500
pc, and the <$\rm EW_{6.7}$> of our CV candidate sample is close to the $\rm
EW_{6.7}$ value of Galactic diffuse X-ray emission.

标题: The Power of Matching for Online Fractional Hedonic Games
摘要: We study coalition formation in the framework of fractional hedonic games
(FHGs). The objective is to maximize social welfare in an online model where
agents arrive one by one and must be assigned to coalitions immediately and
irrevocably. For general online FHGs, it is known that computing maximal
matchings achieves the optimal competitive ratio, which is, however, unbounded
for unbounded agent valuations.
  We achieve a constant competitive ratio in two related settings while carving
out further connections to matchings. If algorithms can dissolve coalitions,
then the optimal competitive ratio of $\frac{1}{6+4\sqrt{2}}$ is achieved by a
matching-based algorithm. Moreover, we perform a tight analysis for the online
matching setting under random arrival with an unknown number of agents. This
entails a randomized $\frac 16$-competitive algorithm for FHGs, while no
algorithm can be better than $\frac 13$-competitive.

标题: ABAMGuid+: An Enhanced Aerocapture Guidance Framework using Augmented Bank Angle Modulation
摘要: Aerocapture consists of converting a hyperbolic approach trajectory into a
captured target orbit utilizing the aerodynamic forces generated via a single
pass through the atmosphere. Aerocapture guidance systems must be robust to
significant environmental variations and modeling uncertainty, particularly
regarding atmospheric properties and delivery conditions. Recent work has shown
that enabling control over both bank angle and angle of attack, a strategy
referred to as augmented bank angle modulation (ABAM), can improve robustness
to entry state and atmospheric uncertainties. In this work, we derive optimal
control solutions for an aerocapture vehicle using ABAM. We first formulate the
problem using a linear aerodynamic model and derive closed-form optimal control
profiles using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. To increase modeling fidelity,
we also consider a quadratic aerodynamic model and obtain the solution directly
using the optimality conditions. Both formulations are solved numerically using
Gauss pseudospectral methods (via GPOPS, a software tool for pseudospectral
optimal control), to validate the analytic solutions. We then introduce a novel
aerocapture guidance algorithm, ABAMGuid+, which indirectly minimizes
propellant usage by mimicking the structure of the optimal control solution,
enabling efficient guidance by avoiding the complexity of solving the full
optimal control problem online. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a Uranus
aerocapture mission demonstrate that ABAMGuid+ increases capture success rates
and reduces post-capture propellant requirements relative to previous methods.

标题: Discovering novel order parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena
摘要: Machine learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have
demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models,
even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin
states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of novel
alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square
lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states
rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic
finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these observables, including
a magnetization-like observable derived from a reduced spin representation,
accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and
exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical
benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships
between these alternative order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively
encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our
results provide a thermodynamic basis for ML's success in reduced
representations. This work bridges data-driven ML approaches with fundamental
statistical mechanics, showing that criticality in Potts systems can be encoded
in more compact, non-traditional forms, and opens avenues for discovering
analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.

标题: Representation of tensor functions using low-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group
摘要: The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive
modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors.
Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a
structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point
group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s.
Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many
point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its
practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated
the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic
materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only,
although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully
establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all
two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a
structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional
point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor
functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so
researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling
applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of
materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues,
etc.

标题: Control of encounter kinetics by chemically active droplets
摘要: Biomolecular condensates play a crucial role in the spatial organization of
living matter. These membrane-less organelles, resulting from liquid-liquid
phase separation, operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with their size
and stability influenced by non-equilibrium chemical reactions. While
condensates are frequently considered optimized nanoreactors that enhance
molecular encounters, their actual impact on reaction kinetics remains unclear
due to competing effects such as diffusion hindrance, and random trapping in
non-specific condensates. In this study, we develop a microscopic, stochastic
model for chemically active droplets, incorporating reaction-driven modulation
of protein interactions. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate
how protein interactions and active coupling to a free energy reservoir
influence phase separation, molecular transport and reaction kinetics. We
demonstrate that the intensity of the chemical drive governs surface dynamics,
generating fluxes that modulate bimolecular reaction rates. Comparing active
emulsions to homogeneous systems, we reveal that condensates can either
accelerate or decelerate molecular encounters. Our findings provide key
insights into the role of biomolecular condensates as potential regulators of
intracellular reaction kinetics.

标题: MM-Skin: Enhancing Dermatology Vision-Language Model with an Image-Text Dataset Derived from Textbooks
摘要: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as clinical
assistants across various medical fields. However, specialized dermatology VLM
capable of delivering professional and detailed diagnostic analysis remains
underdeveloped, primarily due to less specialized text descriptions in current
dermatology multimodal datasets. To address this issue, we propose MM-Skin, the
first large-scale multimodal dermatology dataset that encompasses 3 imaging
modalities, including clinical, dermoscopic, and pathological and nearly 10k
high-quality image-text pairs collected from professional textbooks. In
addition, we generate over 27k diverse, instruction-following vision question
answering (VQA) samples (9 times the size of current largest dermatology VQA
dataset). Leveraging public datasets and MM-Skin, we developed SkinVL, a
dermatology-specific VLM designed for precise and nuanced skin disease
interpretation. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations of SkinVL on VQA,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and zero-shot classification tasks across 8
datasets, reveal its exceptional performance for skin diseases in comparison to
both general and medical VLM models. The introduction of MM-Skin and SkinVL
offers a meaningful contribution to advancing the development of clinical
dermatology VLM assistants. MM-Skin is available at

标题: Estimating Quality in Therapeutic Conversations: A Multi-Dimensional Natural Language Processing Framework
摘要: Engagement between client and therapist is a critical determinant of
therapeutic success. We propose a multi-dimensional natural language processing
(NLP) framework that objectively classifies engagement quality in counseling
sessions based on textual transcripts. Using 253 motivational interviewing
transcripts (150 high-quality, 103 low-quality), we extracted 42 features
across four domains: conversational dynamics, semantic similarity as topic
alignment, sentiment classification, and question detection. Classifiers,
including Random Forest (RF), Cat-Boost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM),
were hyperparameter tuned and trained using a stratified 5-fold
cross-validation and evaluated on a holdout test set. On balanced
(non-augmented) data, RF achieved the highest classification accuracy (76.7%),
and SVM achieved the highest AUC (85.4%). After SMOTE-Tomek augmentation,
performance improved significantly: RF achieved up to 88.9% accuracy, 90.0%
F1-score, and 94.6% AUC, while SVM reached 81.1% accuracy, 83.1% F1-score, and
93.6% AUC. The augmented data results reflect the potential of the framework in
future larger-scale applications. Feature contribution revealed conversational
dynamics and semantic similarity between clients and therapists were among the
top contributors, led by words uttered by the client (mean and standard
deviation). The framework was robust across the original and augmented datasets
and demonstrated consistent improvements in F1 scores and recall. While
currently text-based, the framework supports future multimodal extensions
(e.g., vocal tone, facial affect) for more holistic assessments. This work
introduces a scalable, data-driven method for evaluating engagement quality of
the therapy session, offering clinicians real-time feedback to enhance the
quality of both virtual and in-person therapeutic interactions.

标题: A Scaling Law for Token Efficiency in LLM Fine-Tuning Under Fixed Compute Budgets
摘要: We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under
fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition.
Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the
number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset
volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned
following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset
\cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset
\cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple
subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects
token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM
fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

标题: Can Prompting LLMs Unlock Hate Speech Detection across Languages? A Zero-shot and Few-shot Study
摘要: Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing
approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual
instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ
offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in
identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains
underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight
non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing
them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot
prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world
evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for
hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a
critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting
techniques to maximize performance.

标题: Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Boolean Satisfiability
摘要: Learning-augmented algorithms are a prominent recent development in beyond
worst-case analysis. In this framework, a problem instance is provided with a
prediction (``advice'') from a machine-learning oracle, which provides partial
information about an optimal solution, and the goal is to design algorithms
that leverage this advice to improve worst-case performance. We study the
classic Boolean satisfiability (SAT) decision and optimization problems within
this framework using two forms of advice. ``Subset advice" provides a random
$\epsilon$ fraction of the variables from an optimal assignment, whereas
``label advice" provides noisy predictions for all variables in an optimal
assignment.
  For the decision problem $k$-SAT, by using the subset advice we accelerate
the exponential running time of the PPSZ family of algorithms due to Paturi,
Pudlak, Saks and Zane, which currently represent the state of the art in the
worst case. We accelerate the running time by a multiplicative factor of
$2^{-c}$ in the base of the exponent, where $c$ is a function of $\epsilon$ and
$k$. For the optimization problem, we show how to incorporate subset advice in
a black-box fashion with any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm, improving the
approximation ratio to $\alpha + (1 - \alpha)\epsilon$. Specifically, we
achieve approximations of $0.94 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$2$-SAT, $7/8 +
\Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$3$-SAT, and $0.79 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-SAT.
Moreover, for label advice, we obtain near-optimal approximation for instances
with large average degree, thereby generalizing recent results on MAX-CUT and
MAX-$2$-LIN.

标题: Towards Robust Few-Shot Text Classification Using Transformer Architectures and Dual Loss Strategies
摘要: Few-shot text classification has important application value in low-resource
environments. This paper proposes a strategy that combines adaptive
fine-tuning, contrastive learning, and regularization optimization to improve
the classification performance of Transformer-based models. Experiments on the
FewRel 2.0 dataset show that T5-small, DeBERTa-v3, and RoBERTa-base perform
well in few-shot tasks, especially in the 5-shot setting, which can more
effectively capture text features and improve classification accuracy. The
experiment also found that there are significant differences in the
classification difficulty of different relationship categories. Some categories
have fuzzy semantic boundaries or complex feature distributions, making it
difficult for the standard cross entropy loss to learn the discriminative
information required to distinguish categories. By introducing contrastive loss
and regularization loss, the generalization ability of the model is enhanced,
effectively alleviating the overfitting problem in few-shot environments. In
addition, the research results show that the use of Transformer models or
generative architectures with stronger self-attention mechanisms can help
improve the stability and accuracy of few-shot classification.

标题: Fast recovery of parametric eigenvalues depending on several parameters and location of high order exceptional points
摘要: A numerical algorithm is proposed to deal with parametric eigenvalue problems
involving non-Hermitian matrices and is exploited to find location of defective
eigenvalues in the parameter space of non-hermitian parametric eigenvalue
problems. These non-Hermitian degeneracies also called exceptional points (EP)
have raised considerable attention in the scientific community as these can
have a great impact in a variety of physical problems. The method first
requires the computation of high order derivatives of a few selected
eigenvalues with respect to each parameter involved. The second step is to
recombine these quantities to form new coefficients associated with a partial
characteristic polynomial (PCP). By construction, these coefficients are
regular functions in a large domain of the parameter space which means that the
PCP allows one to recover the selected eigenvalues as well as the localization
of high order EPs by simply using standard root-finding algorithms. The
versatility of the proposed approach is tested on several applications, from
mass-spring systems to guided acoustic waves with absorbing walls and rooms
acoustics. The scalability of the method to large sparse matrices arising from
conventional discretization techniques such as the finite element method is
demonstrated. The proposed approach can be extended to a large number of
applications where EPs play an important role in quantum mechanics, optics and
photonics or in mechanical engineering.

标题: Robust Method for Confidence Interval Estimation in Outlier-Prone Datasets: Application to Molecular and Biophysical Data
摘要: Estimating confidence intervals in small or noisy datasets is a challenge in
biomolecular research when data contain outliers or high variability. We
introduce a robust method combining a hybrid bootstrap procedure with Steiner's
most frequent value (MFV) approach to estimate confidence intervals without
removing outliers or altering the dataset. The MFV identifies the most
representative value while minimizing information loss, ideal for limited or
non-Gaussian samples. To demonstrate robustness, we apply the MFV-hybrid
parametric bootstrapping (MFV-HPB) framework to the fast-neutron activation
cross-section of the 109Ag(n,2n)108mAg reaction, a nuclear physics dataset with
large uncertainties and evaluation difficulties. Repeated resampling and
uncertainty-based simulations yield a robust MFV of 709 mb with a 68.27%
confidence interval of [691, 744] mb, illustrating the method's
interpretability in complex scenarios. Although the example is from nuclear
science, similar issues arise in enzymatic kinetics, molecular assays, and
biomarker studies. The MFV-HPB framework offers a generalizable approach for
extracting central estimates and confidence intervals in small or noisy
datasets, with resilience to outliers, minimal distributional assumptions, and
suitability for small samples-making it valuable in molecular medicine,
bioengineering, and biophysics.

标题: Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica
摘要: Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature,
enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe
tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can
achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution
and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable
results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to
understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we
performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and
optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo
approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the
role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as
substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen.
Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of
silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of
the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting
from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal
chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially
limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.

标题: Realistic Adversarial Attacks for Robustness Evaluation of Trajectory Prediction Models via Future State Perturbation
摘要: Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems,
enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users.
Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is
essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current
approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding
agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical
vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of
model performance in real-world conditions.
  In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future
states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and
thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel
approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors,
enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new
performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial
trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model
revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under
adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks
can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect
potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results
underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better
evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for
autonomous vehicles.

标题: BrainSegDMlF: A Dynamic Fusion-enhanced SAM for Brain Lesion Segmentation
摘要: The segmentation of substantial brain lesions is a significant and
challenging task in the field of medical image segmentation. Substantial brain
lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries
between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices
are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of
abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex.
Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on
single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information
commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire
brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective
integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a
holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of
data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in
detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on
external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some
extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed
a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for
brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following
features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and
integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM
encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling
Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features
even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3)
Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks
automatically without requiring manual prompts.

标题: ELA-ZSON: Efficient Layout-Aware Zero-Shot Object Navigation Agent with Hierarchical Planning
摘要: We introduce ELA-ZSON, an efficient layout-aware zero-shot object navigation
(ZSON) approach designed for complex multi-room indoor environments.
  By planning hierarchically leveraging a global topologigal map with layout
information and local imperative approach with detailed scene representation
memory, ELA-ZSON achieves both efficient and effective navigation.
  The process is managed by an LLM-powered agent, ensuring seamless effective
planning and navigation, without the need for human interaction, complex
rewards, or costly training.
  Our experimental results on the MP3D benchmark achieves 85\% object
navigation success rate (SR) and 79\% success rate weighted by path length
(SPL) (over 40\% point improvement in SR and 60\% improvement in SPL compared
to exsisting methods). Furthermore, we validate the robustness of our approach
through virtual agent and real-world robotic deployment, showcasing its
capability in practical scenarios. See

标题: Above-room-temperature ferromagnetism in large-area epitaxial Fe3GaTe2/graphene van der Waals heterostructures
摘要: Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a two-dimensional (2D) layered ferromagnetic metal, exhibits
a high Curie temperature (TC) ~ 360 K along with strong perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA), making it a promising material candidate for next-generation
energy-efficient magnetic devices. However, the vast majority of studies on
FGaT to date have been limited to millimeter-sized bulk crystals and exfoliated
flakes, which are unsuitable for practical applications and integration into
device processing. Also, its combination with other 2D materials to form van
der Waals heterostructures has only been achieved by flake stacking.
Consequently, the controlled large-scale growth of FGaT and related
heterostructures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate a
breakthrough in the high-quality, large-scale growth of epitaxial FGaT thin
films on single-crystalline graphene/SiC templates using molecular beam
epitaxy. Structural characterization confirms the high crystalline quality of
the continuous FGaT/graphene van der Waals heterostructures.
Temperature-dependent magnetization and anomalous Hall measurements reveal
robust PMA with an enhanced TC well above room temperature, reaching up to 400
K. Furthermore, X-ray absorption and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra
provide insight into the spin and orbital magnetic moment contributions,
further validating the high TC and robust PMA. These findings are highly
significant for the future development of high-performance spintronic devices
based on 2D heterostructures, with potential applications in next-generation
data storage, logic processing and quantum technologies.

标题: FastDup: a scalable duplicate marking tool using speculation-and-test mechanism
摘要: Duplicate marking is a critical preprocessing step in gene sequence analysis
to flag redundant reads arising from polymerase chain reaction(PCR)
amplification and sequencing artifacts. Although Picard MarkDuplicates is
widely recognized as the gold-standard tool, its single-threaded implementation
and reliance on global sorting result in significant computational and resource
overhead, limiting its efficiency on large-scale datasets. Here, we introduce
FastDup: a high-performance, scalable solution that follows the
speculation-and-test mechanism. FastDup achieves up to 20x throughput speedup
and guarantees 100\% identical output compared to Picard MarkDuplicates.

标题: KRRF: Kinodynamic Rapidly-exploring Random Forest algorithm for multi-goal motion planning
摘要: The problem of kinodynamic multi-goal motion planning is to find a trajectory
over multiple target locations with an apriori unknown sequence of visits. The
objective is to minimize the cost of the trajectory planned in a cluttered
environment for a robot with a kinodynamic motion model. This problem has yet
to be efficiently solved as it combines two NP-hard problems, the Traveling
Salesman Problem~(TSP) and the kinodynamic motion planning problem. We propose
a novel approximate method called Kinodynamic Rapidly-exploring Random
Forest~(KRRF) to find a collision-free multi-goal trajectory that satisfies the
motion constraints of the robot. KRRF simultaneously grows kinodynamic trees
from all targets towards all other targets while using the other trees as a
heuristic to boost the growth. Once the target-to-target trajectories are
planned, their cost is used to solve the TSP to find the sequence of targets.
The final multi-goal trajectory satisfying kinodynamic constraints is planned
by guiding the RRT-based planner along the target-to-target trajectories in the
TSP sequence. Compared with existing approaches, KRRF provides shorter
target-to-target trajectories and final multi-goal trajectories with $1.1-2$
times lower costs while being computationally faster in most test cases. The
method will be published as an open-source library.

标题: Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times
摘要: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation
of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab
Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle
vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in
\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf
829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf
835} (2022) 137536};
\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108}
(2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a
phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum
process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the
violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit
such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form
among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are
naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical)
string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world
scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light
have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for
both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta
such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational
vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.

标题: LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation
摘要: Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs
have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify
the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they
need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM
conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in
user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn,
fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale
simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn
settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs
we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations
than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks.
Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance
degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant
increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early
turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly
rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a
conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.

标题: The Application of Deep Learning for Lymph Node Segmentation: A Systematic Review
摘要: Automatic lymph node segmentation is the cornerstone for advances in computer
vision tasks for early detection and staging of cancer. Traditional
segmentation methods are constrained by manual delineation and variability in
operator proficiency, limiting their ability to achieve high accuracy. The
introduction of deep learning technologies offers new possibilities for
improving the accuracy of lymph node image analysis. This study evaluates the
application of deep learning in lymph node segmentation and discusses the
methodologies of various deep learning architectures such as convolutional
neural networks, encoder-decoder networks, and transformers in analyzing
medical imaging data across different modalities. Despite the advancements, it
still confronts challenges like the shape diversity of lymph nodes, the
scarcity of accurately labeled datasets, and the inadequate development of
methods that are robust and generalizable across different imaging modalities.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a
comprehensive overview of the application of deep learning techniques in lymph
node segmentation task. Furthermore, this study also explores potential future
research directions, including multimodal fusion techniques, transfer learning,
and the use of large-scale pre-trained models to overcome current limitations
while enhancing cancer diagnosis and treatment planning strategies.

标题: Photovoltaic Defect Image Generator with Boundary Alignment Smoothing Constraint for Domain Shift Mitigation
摘要: Accurate defect detection of photovoltaic (PV) cells is critical for ensuring
quality and efficiency in intelligent PV manufacturing systems. However, the
scarcity of rich defect data poses substantial challenges for effective model
training. While existing methods have explored generative models to augment
datasets, they often suffer from instability, limited diversity, and domain
shifts. To address these issues, we propose PDIG, a Photovoltaic Defect Image
Generator based on Stable Diffusion (SD). PDIG leverages the strong priors
learned from large-scale datasets to enhance generation quality under limited
data. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic Concept Embedding (SCE) module that
incorporates text-conditioned priors to capture the relational concepts between
defect types and their appearances. To further enrich the domain distribution,
we design a Lightweight Industrial Style Adaptor (LISA), which injects
industrial defect characteristics into the SD model through cross-disentangled
attention. At inference, we propose a Text-Image Dual-Space Constraints (TIDSC)
module, enforcing the quality of generated images via positional consistency
and spatial smoothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDIG
achieves superior realism and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Specifically, our approach improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 19.16
points over the second-best method and significantly enhances the performance
of downstream defect detection tasks.

标题: FIC-TSC: Learning Time Series Classification with Fisher Information Constraint
摘要: Analyzing time series data is crucial to a wide spectrum of applications,
including economics, online marketplaces, and human healthcare. In particular,
time series classification plays an indispensable role in segmenting different
phases in stock markets, predicting customer behavior, and classifying worker
actions and engagement levels. These aspects contribute significantly to the
advancement of automated decision-making and system optimization in real-world
applications. However, there is a large consensus that time series data often
suffers from domain shifts between training and test sets, which dramatically
degrades the classification performance. Despite the success of (reversible)
instance normalization in handling the domain shifts for time series regression
tasks, its performance in classification is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we
propose \textit{FIC-TSC}, a training framework for time series classification
that leverages Fisher information as the constraint. We theoretically and
empirically show this is an efficient and effective solution to guide the model
converge toward flatter minima, which enhances its generalizability to
distribution shifts. We rigorously evaluate our method on 30 UEA multivariate
and 85 UCR univariate datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over 14 recent state-of-the-art methods.

标题: UniVLA: Learning to Act Anywhere with Task-centric Latent Actions
摘要: A generalist robot should perform effectively across various environments.
However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data
to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single
physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across
different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we
propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment
vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive
task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model.
This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments
and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we
incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within
the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist
policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action
decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and
navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves
superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute
and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed
as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the
training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate
scalable and efficient robot policy learning.

标题: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis on CMU-MOSEI Dataset using Transformer-based Models
摘要: This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI
dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text,
audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality,
extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model
achieves strong performance, with 97.87\% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682
F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in
capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization
(lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and
robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in
modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise
sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or
enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by
effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment
analysis.

标题: Competition and Collusion in Two-Sided Markets with an Outside Option
摘要: We introduce pricing formulas for competition and collusion models of
two-sided markets with an outside option. For the competition model, we find
conditions under which prices and consumer surplus may increase or decrease if
the outside option utility increases. Therefore, neglecting the outside option
can lead to either overestimation or underestimation of these equilibrium
outputs. Comparing collusion to competition, we find that in cases of small
cross-side externalities, collusion results in decreased normalized net
deterministic utilities, reduced market participation and increased price, on
both sides of the market. Additionally, we observe that as the number of
platforms increases in the competition model, market participation rises.
Profits, however, decrease when the net normalized deterministic utility is
sufficiently low but increase when it is high. Furthermore, we identify
specific conditions that quantify the change of price and consumer surplus when
the competition increases.

标题: LLMs Outperform Experts on Challenging Biology Benchmarks
摘要: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on
eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning,
virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between
November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per
benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological
capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the
challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study
period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists.
Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other
challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology
subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not
substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended
reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved
performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and
the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below
100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark
data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation
methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.

标题: Differentiating Emigration from Return Migration of Scholars Using Name-Based Nationality Detection Models
摘要: Most web and digital trace data do not include information about an
individual's nationality due to privacy concerns. The lack of data on
nationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a
left-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of
origin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can
differentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the
nationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the
detected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which
is a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6
million unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into
families of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training
data. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1
score of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level
categorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to
assign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our
results show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for
nationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries
with a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada.
We found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once
we used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic
origin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has
consistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have
Chinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin. Our proposed
methods for addressing left-censoring issues are beneficial for other research
that uses digital trace data to study migration.

标题: S2MNet: Speckle-To-Mesh Net for Three-Dimensional Cardiac Morphology Reconstruction via Echocardiogram
摘要: Echocardiogram is the most commonly used imaging modality in cardiac
assessment duo to its non-invasive nature, real-time capability, and
cost-effectiveness. Despite its advantages, most clinical echocardiograms
provide only two-dimensional views, limiting the ability to fully assess
cardiac anatomy and function in three dimensions. While three-dimensional
echocardiography exists, it often suffers from reduced resolution, limited
availability, and higher acquisition costs. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a deep learning framework S2MNet that reconstructs continuous and
high-fidelity 3D heart models by integrating six slices of routinely acquired
2D echocardiogram views. Our method has three advantages. First, our method
avoid the difficulties on training data acquasition by simulate six of 2D
echocardiogram images from corresponding slices of a given 3D heart mesh.
Second, we introduce a deformation field-based method, which avoid spatial
discontinuities or structural artifacts in 3D echocardiogram reconstructions.
We validate our method using clinically collected echocardiogram and
demonstrate that our estimated left ventricular volume, a key clinical
indicator of cardiac function, is strongly correlated with the doctor measured
GLPS, a clinical measurement that should demonstrate a negative correlation
with LVE in medical theory. This association confirms the reliability of our
proposed 3D construction method.

标题: Fermionic quantum cosmology as a framework for resolving type IV singularities
摘要: In this paper, we present an innovative approach to resolving type IV
singularities in fermionic quantum cosmology. The Eisenhart-Duval lift
procedure is employed to construct an extended minisuperspace metric, which
allows for the formulation of the Dirac equation in minisuperspace. Through
this approach, fermionic degrees of freedom are effectively incorporated into a
homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with a scalar field. By applying a
kind of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, solutions to the Dirac equation for
an approximate potential characteristic of type IV singularities are obtained,
expressed in terms of Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions and associated
Laguerre polynomials. The elimination of non-physical, divergent solutions
results in a quantum regularization of the classical singularity. These results
indicate the potential of fermionic models in quantum cosmology for mitigating
the singularity problem.

标题: How to tame penguins: Advancing to high-precision measurements of $φ_d$ and $φ_s$
摘要: The complex phases $\phi_d$ and $\phi_s$, associated with the mixing between
neutral $B_q^0$ and $\bar B_q^0$ mesons ($q\in\{d,s\}$), are key observables to
test the Standard Model and search for contributions from new physics. They are
conventionally determined from the measurements of mixing-induced CP violation
in the decays $B_d^0\to J/\psi K^0$, $B_s^0\to J/\psi\phi$ and $B_s^0\to
D_s^+D_s^-$. To reach the highest possible precision on $\phi_d$ and $\phi_s$,
it is crucial that corrections from next-to-leading order effects - primarily
associated with penguin decay topologies - are accounted for. The strategy
adopted in this paper uses the $SU(3)$ flavour symmetry of QCD to relate the
unknown contributions from penguin topologies to their counterparts in
suitably-chosen control modes, where their effects are enhanced. Utilising new
CP asymmetry measurements from LHCb on the decays $B_s^0\to D_s^+D_s^-$,
$B_d^0\to D^+D^-$, $B^+\to J/\psi K^+$ and $B^+\to J/\psi\pi^+$, as well as
from Belle-II on the decay $B_d^0\to J/\psi\pi^0$, we present the current
state-of-the-art picture on controlling the penguin contributions and extract
$\phi_d$ and $\phi_s$ from the corresponding observables. We explore the
prospects for the end of the Belle-II and HL-LHC flavour physics programmes,
and demonstrate the importance of measuring the control modes with future data.

标题: Discretized Approximate Ancestral Sampling
摘要: The Fourier Basis Density Model (FBM) was recently introduced as a flexible
probability model for band-limited distributions, i.e. ones which are smooth in
the sense of having a characteristic function with limited support around the
origin. Its density and cumulative distribution functions can be efficiently
evaluated and trained with stochastic optimization methods, which makes the
model suitable for deep learning applications. However, the model lacked
support for sampling. Here, we introduce a method inspired by
discretization--interpolation methods common in Digital Signal Processing,
which directly take advantage of the band-limited property. We review
mathematical properties of the FBM, and prove quality bounds of the sampled
distribution in terms of the total variation (TV) and Wasserstein--1
divergences from the model. These bounds can be used to inform the choice of
hyperparameters to reach any desired sample quality. We discuss these results
in comparison to a variety of other sampling techniques, highlighting tradeoffs
between computational complexity and sampling quality.

标题: Free and Fair Hardware: A Pathway to Copyright Infringement-Free Verilog Generation using LLMs
摘要: Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design
tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various
fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source
repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain
minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright
violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to
estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected
codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset,
FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation
framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data.
We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual
pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our
results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of
copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate.
Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog
generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10
rates by over 10%.

标题: A Piezoelectric Molecular Cocrystal with Unconventional $π$-Stacking
摘要: We demonstrate the crystallization of a polar octafluoronaphthalene (OFN,
\OFN)--phthalazine (Phth, \Phth) cocrystal, formed in a 1:2 ratio by slow
evaporation. The crystal structure and vibrational properties of the cocrystal
were determined using powder/single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and confirmed with density
functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)
calculations. The molecular $\pi$-stacking of aromatic rings is unconventional
compared with other arene--perfluoroarene cocrystals. Phth molecules are offset
and misaligned with respect to the major axis of OFN due to electrostatic
repulsion between N and F atoms, enabling overall electric polarization
attributed to the dipole moment of Phth. Our calculations show that OFN:2Phth
is an insulator with a band gap of $\sim$2.4 eV. The electric polarization was
calculated to be 7.1 \muC, while the shear piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{34}$)
may be as large as 11.4 pC N$^{-1}$.

标题: XUE. JWST spectroscopy of externally irradiated disks around young intermediate-mass stars
摘要: Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star
forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the
protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now
with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars.
We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first
detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner
disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from
nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of
12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC
6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the
XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their
molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m
silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri
disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular
richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate
features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$,
but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk
properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting
that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence
of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures
suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons.
However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical
richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme
environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet
formation.

标题: Robot Learning Using Multi-Coordinate Elastic Maps
摘要: To learn manipulation skills, robots need to understand the features of those
skills. An easy way for robots to learn is through Learning from Demonstration
(LfD), where the robot learns a skill from an expert demonstrator. While the
main features of a skill might be captured in one differential coordinate
(i.e., Cartesian), they could have meaning in other coordinates. For example,
an important feature of a skill may be its shape or velocity profile, which are
difficult to discover in Cartesian differential coordinate. In this work, we
present a method which enables robots to learn skills from human demonstrations
via encoding these skills into various differential coordinates, then
determines the importance of each coordinate to reproduce the skill. We also
introduce a modified form of Elastic Maps that includes multiple differential
coordinates, combining statistical modeling of skills in these differential
coordinate spaces. Elastic Maps, which are flexible and fast to compute, allow
for the incorporation of several different types of constraints and the use of
any number of demonstrations. Additionally, we propose methods for auto-tuning
several parameters associated with the modified Elastic Map formulation. We
validate our approach in several simulated experiments and a real-world writing
task with a UR5e manipulator arm.

标题: UniSymNet: A Unified Symbolic Network Guided by Transformer
摘要: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically
discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms
search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the
increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired
by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm.
However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary
nonlinear operators $\{\times, \div\}$ cannot be naturally extended to
multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to
higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic
Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and
define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we
pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide
structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to
learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting
accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression
complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard
Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.

标题: Serendipitous discovery of a spiral host in a 2 Mpc double-double lobed radio galaxy
摘要: We present the serendipitous discovery of a double-double radio galaxy (DDRG)
with a projected linear size exceeding 2 Mpc, hosted by a spiral galaxy. This
unique combination of a giant radio structure and a spiral host challenges the
prevailing view that such extreme radio sources reside only in elliptical
galaxies. Using high-resolution optical imaging from the DESI Legacy Imaging
Survey (DR10), we confirm a spiral-arm feature and a disk-component in the
surface brightness profile fitting for the host galaxy (LEDA 896325) having a
black hole of mass 2.4 $\times$ 10$^8$ $\rm M_{\odot}$. Radio observations from
RACS and GLEAM reveal two distinct pairs of radio lobes. Using the
multi-frequency analysis of radio data, we obtained the spectral index
distribution and estimate the spectral ages of the outer and inner radio lobes
to be approximately 120 and 35 Myr, respectively. Our results confirm recurrent
jet activity in this disk galaxy and establish it as the largest known radio
galaxy in a spiral host, and its double-double structure makes it the largest
of only three such spiral-host DDRGs, demonstrating that disk galaxies can
indeed launch extremely large-scale radio jets.

标题: Deep Diffusion Maps
摘要: One of the fundamental problems within the field of machine learning is
dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods make it possible to
combat the so-called curse of dimensionality, visualize high-dimensional data
and, in general, improve the efficiency of storing and processing large data
sets. One of the best-known nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods is
Diffusion Maps. However, despite their virtues, both Diffusion Maps and many
other manifold learning methods based on the spectral decomposition of kernel
matrices have drawbacks such as the inability to apply them to data outside the
initial set, their computational complexity, and high memory costs for large
data sets. In this work, we propose to alleviate these problems by resorting to
deep learning. Specifically, a new formulation of Diffusion Maps embedding is
offered as a solution to a certain unconstrained minimization problem and,
based on it, a cost function to train a neural network which computes Diffusion
Maps embedding -- both inside and outside the training sample -- without the
need to perform any spectral decomposition. The capabilities of this approach
are compared on different data sets, both real and synthetic, with those of
Diffusion Maps and the Nystrom method.

标题: Validating Griffith fracture propagation in the phase-field approach to fracture: The case of Mode III by means of the trousers test
摘要: At present, there is an abundance of results showing that the phase-field
approach to fracture in elastic brittle materials -- when properly accounting
for material strength -- describes the \emph{nucleation} of fracture from large
pre-existing cracks in a manner that is consistent with the Griffith
competition between bulk deformation energy and surface fracture energy. By
contrast, results that demonstrate the ability of this approach to describe
Griffith fracture \emph{propagation} are scarce and restricted to Mode I. Aimed
at addressing this lacuna, the main objective of this paper is to show that the
phase-field approach to fracture describes Mode III fracture propagation in a
manner that is indeed consistent with the Griffith energy competition. This is
accomplished via direct comparisons between phase-field predictions for
fracture propagation in the so-called \emph{trousers} \emph{test} and the
corresponding results that emerge from the Griffith energy competition. The
latter are generated from full-field finite-element solutions that -- as an
additional critical contribution of this paper -- also serve to bring to light
the hitherto unexplored limitations of the classical Rivlin-Thomas-Greensmith
formulas that are routinely used to analyze the trousers test.

标题: Assessing Tenstorrent's RISC-V MatMul Acceleration Capabilities
摘要: The increasing demand for generative AI as Large Language Models (LLMs)
services has driven the need for specialized hardware architectures that
optimize computational efficiency and energy consumption. This paper evaluates
the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic
linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation
in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's
execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical
precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's
performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration,
including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100).
Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a
competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput,
reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.

标题: Towards time series aggregation with exact error quantification for optimization of energy systems
摘要: Energy system optimization models are becoming increasingly popular for
analyzing energy markets, such as the impact of new policies or interactions
between energy carriers. One key challenge of these models is the trade-off
between modeling accuracy and computational tractability. A recently proposed
mathematical framework addresses this challenge by achieving exact time series
aggregations merging time periods sharing the same active constraint sets. This
aggregation, however, is insufficient when the number of unique active
constraints is large. We overcome this issue by aggregating data points from
different active constraint sets. While this further reduces model size, it
inevitably introduces an error compared to the full model. Yet, we show how
this error can be exactly quantified without re-solving the optimization
problem, enabling users to trade off computational efficiency and model
accuracy proactively. This may be especially useful in energy markets to
accommodate varying granularity across short- and long-term time horizons.

标题: Fault Diagnosis of 3D-Printed Scaled Wind Turbine Blades
摘要: This study presents an integrated methodology for fault detection in wind
turbine blades using 3D-printed scaled models, finite element simulations,
experimental modal analysis, and machine learning techniques. A scaled model of
the NREL 5MW blade was fabricated using 3D printing, and crack-type damages
were introduced at critical locations. Finite Element Analysis was employed to
predict the impact of these damages on the natural frequencies, with the
results validated through controlled hammer impact tests. Vibration data was
processed to extract both time-domain and frequency-domain features, and key
discriminative variables were identified using statistical analyses (ANOVA).
Machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest
Neighbors, achieved classification accuracies exceeding 94%. The results
revealed that vibration modes 3, 4, and 6 are particularly sensitive to
structural anomalies for this blade. This integrated approach confirms the
feasibility of combining numerical simulations with experimental validations
and paves the way for structural health monitoring systems in wind energy
applications.

标题: TREND: Tri-teaching for Robust Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Demonstrations
摘要: Preference feedback collected by human or VLM annotators is often noisy,
presenting a significant challenge for preference-based reinforcement learning
that relies on accurate preference labels. To address this challenge, we
propose TREND, a novel framework that integrates few-shot expert demonstrations
with a tri-teaching strategy for effective noise mitigation. Our method trains
three reward models simultaneously, where each model views its small-loss
preference pairs as useful knowledge and teaches such useful pairs to its peer
network for updating the parameters. Remarkably, our approach requires as few
as one to three expert demonstrations to achieve high performance. We evaluate
TREND on various robotic manipulation tasks, achieving up to 90% success rates
even with noise levels as high as 40%, highlighting its effective robustness in
handling noisy preference feedback. Project page:

标题: The role of non-equilibrium populations in dark exciton formation
摘要: In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide structures, the optical
excitation of a bright exciton may be followed by the formation of a plethora
of lower energy dark states. In these formation and relaxation processes
between different exciton species, non-equilibrium exciton and phonon
populations play a dominant role, but remain so far largely unexplored as most
states are inaccessible by regular spectroscopies. Here, on the example of
homobilayer 2H-MoS$_2$, we realize direct access to the full exciton relaxation
cascade from experiment and theory. By measuring the energy- and in-plane
momentum-resolved photoemission spectral function, we reveal a distinct
fingerprint for dark excitons in a non-equilibrium excitonic occupation
distribution. In excellent agreement with microscopic many-particle
calculations, we quantify the timescales for the formation of a non-equilibrium
dark excitonic occupation and its subsequent thermalization to 85~fs and
150~fs, respectively. Our results provide a previously inaccessible view of the
complete exciton relaxation cascade, which is of paramount importance for the
future characterization of non-equilibrium excitonic phases and the efficient
design of optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials.

标题: Smooth optimization algorithms for global and locally low-rank regularizers
摘要: Many inverse problems and signal processing problems involve low-rank
regularizers based on the nuclear norm. Commonly, proximal gradient methods
(PGM) are adopted to solve this type of non-smooth problems as they can offer
fast and guaranteed convergence. However, PGM methods cannot be simply applied
in settings where low-rank models are imposed locally on overlapping patches;
therefore, heuristic approaches have been proposed that lack convergence
guarantees. In this work we propose to replace the nuclear norm with a smooth
approximation in which a Huber-type function is applied to each singular value.
By providing a theoretical framework based on singular value function theory,
we show that important properties can be established for the proposed
regularizer, such as: convexity, differentiability, and Lipschitz continuity of
the gradient. Moreover, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularizer
gradient, enabling the use of standard iterative gradient-based optimization
algorithms (e.g., nonlinear conjugate gradient) that can easily address the
case of overlapping patches and have well-known convergence guarantees. In
addition, we provide a novel step-size selection strategy based on a quadratic
majorizer of the line-search function that leverages the Huber characteristics
of the proposed regularizer. Finally, we assess the proposed optimization
framework by providing empirical results in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) reconstruction in the context of locally low-rank models with overlapping
patches.

employing an asymmetric cost function to minimize fuel-intensive acceleration.
Following vehicles utilize a gap- and velocity-based control strategy,
complemented by dynamic platoon splitting logic communicated through Platoon

obtained from the CARLA environment demonstrate substantial fuel savings of up
to 41.2%, along with smoother traffic flows, fewer vehicle stops, and improved

标题: Noise-Consistent Siamese-Diffusion for Medical Image Synthesis and Segmentation
摘要: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, yet its full
potential remains constrained by the paucity of annotated datasets. While
diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for generating synthetic
image-mask pairs to augment these datasets, they paradoxically suffer from the
same data scarcity challenges they aim to mitigate. Traditional mask-only
models frequently yield low-fidelity images due to their inability to
adequately capture morphological intricacies, which can critically compromise
the robustness and reliability of segmentation models. To alleviate this
limitation, we introduce Siamese-Diffusion, a novel dual-component model
comprising Mask-Diffusion and Image-Diffusion. During training, a Noise
Consistency Loss is introduced between these components to enhance the
morphological fidelity of Mask-Diffusion in the parameter space. During
sampling, only Mask-Diffusion is used, ensuring diversity and scalability.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.
Siamese-Diffusion boosts SANet's mDice and mIoU by 3.6% and 4.4% on the Polyps,
while UNet improves by 1.52% and 1.64% on the ISIC2018. Code is available at

标题: Modeling complex particle suspensions: perspectives on the rigid multiblob method
摘要: Many suspensions contain particles with complex shapes that are affected not
only by hydrodynamics, but also by thermal fluctuations, internal kinematic
constraints and other long-range non-hydrodynamic interactions. Modeling these
systems represents a significant numerical challenge due to the interplay
between different effects and the need to accurately capture multiscale
phenomena. In this article we review recent developments to model large
suspensions of particles of arbitrary shapes and multiple couplings with
controllable accuracy within the rigid multiblob framework. We discuss the
governing equations, highlight key numerical developments, and illustrate
applications ranging from microswimmers to complex colloidal suspensions. This
review illustrates the effectiveness and versatility of the rigid multiblob
method in tackling a wide range of physical problems in fluid mechanics, soft
matter physics, biophysics, materials and colloidal science.

标题: Context Informed Incremental Learning Improves Myoelectric Control Performance in Virtual Reality Object Manipulation Tasks
摘要: Electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition is a promising approach for
designing intuitive human-computer interfaces. However, while these systems
typically perform well in controlled laboratory settings, their usability in
real-world applications is compromised by declining performance during
real-time control. This decline is largely due to goal-directed behaviors that
are not captured in static, offline scenarios. To address this issue, we use
\textit{Context Informed Incremental Learning} (CIIL) - marking its first
deployment in an object-manipulation scenario - to continuously adapt the
classifier using contextual cues. Nine participants without upper limb
differences completed a functional task in a virtual reality (VR) environment
involving transporting objects with life-like grips. We compared two scenarios:
one where the classifier was adapted in real-time using contextual information,
and the other using a traditional open-loop approach without adaptation. The
CIIL-based approach not only enhanced task success rates and efficiency, but
also reduced the perceived workload by 7.1 %, despite causing a 5.8 % reduction
in offline classification accuracy. This study highlights the potential of
real-time contextualized adaptation to enhance user experience and usability of
EMG-based systems for practical, goal-oriented applications, crucial elements
towards their long-term adoption. The source code for this study is available

标题: Omni-Temporal Theory and Simulation of Hydrodynamic Dispersion using Fourier Transformation
摘要: Hydrodynamic dispersion determines the extent of solute mixing and apparent
diffusive flux in various chemical, geological, and biological systems that
possess flow with strong velocity gradients. Though established dispersion
theory captures the transient interplay between diffusion, flow, and reaction
rates, a long-time approximation is commonly adopted where the characteristic
time scale of flow substantially exceeds that of pore-scale diffusion. Here, we
introduce a frequency-based theory to model omni-temporal dispersion through
porous media that simultaneously captures fast and slow components of
dispersion. To create this theory, we formally volume-average the
Fourier-transformed pore-scale advection-diffusion equation for solute and
obtain up-scaled transport coefficients for a periodic unit cell: a dispersion
tensor, an advection suppression vector, and reaction-rate coefficients. These
coefficients serve dually as transfer functions that correlate certain output
with input quantities in the frequency domain, enabling the prediction of
up-scaled temporal dynamics using inverse Fourier transformation. Their utility
is demonstrated by deriving analytical expressions for the dispersion
coefficient for cases of Poiseuille flow between parallel plates and through
circular tubes. This omni-temporal theory produces breakthrough curves for a
fast solute pulse between inactive parallel plates that agree with the solute
propagation rates predicted by direct numerical simulation (DNS), in contrast
with conventional asymptotic theory that overpredicts such by orders of
magnitude. Deviations in solute peak magnitude from DNS are shown to arise from
solute back-diffusion into the inlet plane as well as entry-region effects that
are evidenced by a non-periodic variation of the closure variable b.

标题: Attention on Multiword Expressions: A Multilingual Study of BERT-based Models with Regard to Idiomaticity and Microsyntax
摘要: This study analyzes the attention patterns of fine-tuned encoder-only models
based on the BERT architecture (BERT-based models) towards two distinct types
of Multiword Expressions (MWEs): idioms and microsyntactic units (MSUs). Idioms
present challenges in semantic non-compositionality, whereas MSUs demonstrate
unconventional syntactic behavior that does not conform to standard grammatical
categorizations. We aim to understand whether fine-tuning BERT-based models on
specific tasks influences their attention to MWEs, and how this attention
differs between semantic and syntactic tasks. We examine attention scores to
MWEs in both pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT-based models. We utilize
monolingual models and datasets in six Indo-European languages - English,
German, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. Our results show that
fine-tuning significantly influences how models allocate attention to MWEs.
Specifically, models fine-tuned on semantic tasks tend to distribute attention
to idiomatic expressions more evenly across layers. Models fine-tuned on
syntactic tasks show an increase in attention to MSUs in the lower layers,
corresponding with syntactic processing requirements.

标题: Learning Dynamical Systems with the Spectral Exterior Calculus
摘要: We present a data-driven framework for learning dynamical systems on compact
Riemannian manifolds based on the spectral exterior calculus (SEC). This
approach represents vector fields as linear combinations of frame elements
constructed using the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on smooth functions,
along with their gradients. Such reconstructed vector fields generate dynamical
flows that consistently approximate the true system, while being compatible
with the nonlinear geometry of the manifold. The data-driven implementation of
this framework utilizes embedded data points and tangent vectors as training
data, along with a graph-theoretic approximation of the Laplacian. In this
paper, we prove the convergence of the SEC-based reconstruction in the limit of
large data. Moreover, we illustrate the approach numerically with applications
to dynamical systems on the unit circle and the 2-torus. In these examples, the
reconstructed vector fields compare well with the true vector fields, in terms
of both pointwise estimates and generation of orbits.

标题: Towards Better Cephalometric Landmark Detection with Diffusion Data Generation
摘要: Cephalometric landmark detection is essential for orthodontic diagnostics and
treatment planning. Nevertheless, the scarcity of samples in data collection
and the extensive effort required for manual annotation have significantly
impeded the availability of diverse datasets. This limitation has restricted
the effectiveness of deep learning-based detection methods, particularly those
based on large-scale vision models. To address these challenges, we have
developed an innovative data generation method capable of producing diverse
cephalometric X-ray images along with corresponding annotations without human
intervention. To achieve this, our approach initiates by constructing new
cephalometric landmark annotations using anatomical priors. Then, we employ a
diffusion-based generator to create realistic X-ray images that correspond
closely with these annotations. To achieve precise control in producing samples
with different attributes, we introduce a novel prompt cephalometric X-ray
image dataset. This dataset includes real cephalometric X-ray images and
detailed medical text prompts describing the images. By leveraging these
detailed prompts, our method improves the generation process to control
different styles and attributes. Facilitated by the large, diverse generated
data, we introduce large-scale vision detection models into the cephalometric
landmark detection task to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that training with the generated data substantially enhances the performance.
Compared to methods without using the generated data, our approach improves the
Success Detection Rate (SDR) by 6.5%, attaining a notable 82.2%. All code and

标题: Safe-EF: Error Feedback for Nonsmooth Constrained Optimization
摘要: Federated learning faces severe communication bottlenecks due to the high
dimensionality of model updates. Communication compression with contractive
compressors (e.g., Top-K) is often preferable in practice but can degrade
performance without proper handling. Error feedback (EF) mitigates such issues
but has been largely restricted for smooth, unconstrained problems, limiting
its real-world applicability where non-smooth objectives and safety constraints
are critical. We advance our understanding of EF in the canonical non-smooth
convex setting by establishing new lower complexity bounds for first-order
algorithms with contractive compression. Next, we propose Safe-EF, a novel
algorithm that matches our lower bound (up to a constant) while enforcing
safety constraints essential for practical applications. Extending our approach
to the stochastic setting, we bridge the gap between theory and practical
implementation. Extensive experiments in a reinforcement learning setup,
simulating distributed humanoid robot training, validate the effectiveness of
Safe-EF in ensuring safety and reducing communication complexity.

标题: pNGB Higgs Naturalness at a Tipping Point
摘要: In scenarios where the Higgs is viewed as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson
(pNGB) the question of naturalness finds itself, from a phenomenological
perspective, at a tipping point between direct searches and precision. If, by
the end of the High-Luminosity LHC operation, all experimental results were to
remain consistent with the Standard Model, precision Higgs coupling
measurements will begin to drive the naturalness tension. To illustrate this
from a fresh perspective we construct a maximally natural `Kitchen Sink' model,
throwing into the mix three approaches to symmetry-based naturalness:
Supersymmetry, Twin Higgs, and pNGB Higgs models with a Gegenbauer potential.
In other words, we build a `Supersymmetric Gegenbauer's Twin' model. This model
not only maximises naturalness, at least from a technical perspective, but can
also interpolate between all three ingredients smoothly, revealing the
interplay between direct exploration and precision. Implications for FCC-ee and
FCC-hh are discussed.

centres. We also relate these localisation centres with the locations of the
maxima of the noise. Actually, our analysis reveals that this relationship
depends in a subtle way on the behaviour near $0$ of the covariance function of
the noise: in some situations, the largest eigenfunctions are not associated
with the largest values of the noise.

标题: Exact S-matrices for higher dimensional representations of generalized Landau-Zener Hamiltonians
摘要: We explore integrable Landau-Zener-type Hamiltonians through the framework of
Lie algebraic structures. By reformulating the classic two-level Landau-Zener
model as a Lax equation, we show that higher-spin generalizations lead to
exactly solvable scattering matrices, which can be computed efficiently for any
higher-spin representation. We further extend this approach to generalized
bow-tie Landau-Zener Hamiltonians, employing non-Abelian gauge fields that
satisfy a zero-curvature condition to derive their scattering matrices
algebraically. This method enables the systematic construction of new exactly
solvable multi-level models; as a result, we present previously unknown
six-dimensional and eight-dimensional Landau-Zener models.

标题: PYRREGULAR: A Unified Framework for Irregular Time Series, with Classification Benchmarks
摘要: Irregular temporal data, characterized by varying recording frequencies,
differing observation durations, and missing values, presents significant
challenges across fields like mobility, healthcare, and environmental science.
Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in
isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository
for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to
enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we
benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work
aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of
irregular temporal data analysis methods.
